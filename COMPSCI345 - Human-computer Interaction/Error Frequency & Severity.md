## Error Frequency
- Relates to how often users make errors
	- #compsci345example 
	- Touch phone typing $\rightarrow$ people tapping on what they don't intend to tap
	- Long & complicated forms
		- It might reduce errors to have a dropdown list to choose from
		- But it might be slower than entering with auto complete

### Measures of Error Frequency
- Not necessarily a 1-Dimensional Measure $\rightarrow$ may have multiple threshold requirements
	- Average = 2 errors/hour
	- Over 50% less than 1 
## Error Severity
- Relates to what is the cost of causing the error
	- #compsci345example 
	- A patient suffers seizures because a drug interaction was missed
	- Booking a flight for 8pm when you wanted 8am
