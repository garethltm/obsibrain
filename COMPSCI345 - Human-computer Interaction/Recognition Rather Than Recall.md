- Minimise memory load, make actions & options visible
	- If I can put the item on a dropdown list, then I should:
		- Why make them type it in & maybe choose an option that's not available?
	- Show the user something
		- Maybe you'll get lucky & it'll be just what they want
	- Basically use menus & lists instead of relying on blanks
