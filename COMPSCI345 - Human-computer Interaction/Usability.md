- the measure of the quality of user's experience when interacting with a product or system
- is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use

### Usability Factors
1. [[Ease of learning]]
	- How fast can a user who has never seen the user interface before learn it sufficiently well to accomplish basic tasks
2. [[Efficiency of use]]
	- Once an experienced user has learned to use the system, how fast can he/she accomplish tasks
3. Memorability
	- If a user has used the system before, can he/she remember enough to use it effectively the next time or does the user have to start over again learning everything
4. Error frequency and severity
	- How often do users make errors while using the system, how serious are these errors, and how do users recover from these errors
5. Subjective satisfaction
	- How much does the user like using the system
