- any money we have today

[[Future Value (FV)]] = [[Present Value (PV)]] $\times\ (1+r)^n$
becomes
[[Present Value (PV)]] = $\frac {FV\tiny {n}}{(1+r)^n}$

#acctg151Gexample You want to go on holiday in exactly 2 years. You expect the cost of the holiday to be exactly $5,000 in 2 years time. 

How much money would you need to place on deposit today so that you had exactly $5,000 in 2 years if deposit rates are 10% p.a?

$PV = \frac {FV\tiny {n}}{(1+r)^n}$
$PV = \frac {\$5,000}{(1+0.10)^2}$
$PV = \$4,132.23$
[[Present Value (PV)]] of an [[Annuity]]
We've considered the [[Future Value (FV)]] of an [[Annuity]] (the target or end-result of a regular savings program) but sometimes we need to consider the [[Present Value (PV)]] of a future stream of payments.

This is the case when we look at paying off a loan (the amount of money we borrow today is the [[Present Value (PV)]] & [[Future Value (FV)]] is of course $0) and is simply the sum of [[Present Value (PV)]] of all the future [[Annuity]] cash-flows:

$PV = \frac {CF\tiny {1}}{}$
