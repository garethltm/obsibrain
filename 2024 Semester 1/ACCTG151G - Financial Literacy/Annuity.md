- multiple cashflows
- a series of equal payments (or receipts) made at fixed time intervals (eg: monthly, quarterly, annually) for a specified number of periods (eg: years).
	- shouldn't be indefinite

### [[Future Value (FV)]] of an [[Annuity]]
- [[Future Value (FV)]] is the value your invested money will grow to when earning a specific rate of interest over a specified time period
- [[compounding]]
- We can find out what the [[Future Value (FV)]] of such an [[Annuity]] is in pretty much the same way as we found the [[Future Value (FV)]] of a single amount
Imagine we're considering saving on a regular basis. We intend saving the same amount each year for the next 4 years. 
The question is - how much will we have at the end of 4 years?
1. [[ordinary annuity]]
2. [[annuity due]]
### Calculating the [[Future Value (FV)]] of an [[Annuity]]
![[Pasted image 20240330213849.png]]
- Mathematicians call this type of equation a "geometric series"
- What we're interested in of course, is how much money we'll have at the end of the period, so we want to find the "sum" of this geometric series (eg. the [[Future Value (FV)]] of the cashflows or CFs).![[Pasted image 20240330214026.png]]

### [[Future Value Interest Factor (FVIF)]] of an [[Annuity]]
This can be simplified even further with the use of tables (just like the one we used for the [[Future Value (FV)]] of a single amount):![[Pasted image 20240330214315.png]]
