- The yield on a [[Bonds or Debentures (Government or Company)]] is the rate of return you would earn if you held the bond for a stated period of time
- The 2 most commonly cited [[Bond yield(s)]] are:
	1. [[current yield]] (to measure annual interest income)
	2. [[yield to maturity (YTM)]]

1. If bond is purchased at [[face(par) value]] then [[yield to maturity (YTM)]] = [[coupon rate]]
2. If bond is purchased at a discount then [[yield to maturity (YTM)]] > [[coupon rate]]
3. If bond is purchased at premium then [[yield to maturity (YTM)]] < [[coupon rate]]
From this we can determine if the bond is selling/purchasing at a discount/premium price
