- represent the debt of the government or company
- provide current income (interest)
- Lower level of risk than shares, but with lower expected returns as well
- Bond valuations (Bond price) inversely related to changes in prevailing [[Interest rates (r)]]
	- #acctg151Gexample If [[Interest rates (r)]] is higher, people would choose to put money into the [[Banks (Commercial Banks)]] instead of purchasing [[Bonds or Debentures (Government or Company)]] $\rightarrow$ demand for bond decreases = bond price decrease
- Government cannot go bankrupt because they can just print money
## Main idea
- they are both bonds. However, company bonds are riskier as the government cannot go bankrupt which means that it is less risk.
