In economics, the [[Average propensity to consume (APC)]] is the fraction of [[Income (Cash IN)]] spent and is computed by diving consumption by income.

#acctg151Gformula
$$APC = \frac {C}{Y}$$
- C = the amount spent (consumed)
	- final purchase of goods
	- #acctg151Gexample
	- iphone, car, tv,...
- Y = (gross income) **BEFORE TAX INCOME**

#### Disposable income
#acctg151Gformula
$$ APC = \frac {C}{Y-T}$$
- T = taxes
==this one is more viable as you can't control the amount of tax you would receive==

The percentage of each dollar of [[Income (Cash IN)]] that is spent, on average, for current needs rather than saved.
- ABSOLUTE necessity $\rightarrow$ what you actually need

#acctg151Gformula
$$\frac{Income\ spent\ on\ current\ needs}{Total\ income} \times \frac{100}{1}$$
