- no downside, always a benefit
- it is possible to reduce the total amount of [[Risk]] through [[Diversification]]
- [[Diversification]] allows us to eliminate [[Firm-specific risk]] but not [[Market risk]]
- [[Diversification]] is achieved by combining [[asset(s)]] which move in different directions at different times; [[asset(s)]] which are less than perfectly positively correlated
- The lower the correlation between 2 [[asset(s)]], the stronger the [[Diversification]] effect.
[[Managed funds]] will help build a large portfolio $\rightarrow$ easy way to achieve [[Diversification]]

## Summary
- Returns often deviate from the expected return
- This deviation is driven by:
	- Market movement as a whole $\rightarrow$ [[Market risk]]
	- A stock's own events $\rightarrow$ [[Firm-specific risk]]
- [[Diversification]] allows us to eliminate [[Firm-specific risk]] only
- [[Market risk]] affects all stocks (to a greater or lesser degree) & cannot be eliminated through [[Diversification]]
