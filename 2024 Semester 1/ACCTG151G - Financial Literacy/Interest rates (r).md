### Earning interest on your money
- [[Interest rates (r)]] can be earned & paid in 3 ways:
	1. Some investments are sold on a discount basis
		- Investment sold for a price lower than redemption value
		- Difference between sales price & redemption value is the amount of interest earned
		 #acctg151Gexample - Treasury bill (T-bill)
		 - Government asks you to buy money cheaper for today's price specially
			 - Buying $1,000 for $900
	2. Other investments offer direct payment of interest to a 'savings' account
		- if you put into savings $\rightarrow$ you give up [[compound interest]]
	3. Still others allow for interest to be added to the principle balance in the savings account

### How is interest calculated?
- [[Nominal rate]]
- [[Effective rate]]

***NOTE: If [[Interest rates (r)]] is compounded more frequently than once a year, the [[Effective rate]] will be greater than the [[Nominal rate]] of interest***

### How much interest will you earn?
The amount of interest earned depends on:
- Frequency of compounding
	- More frequent compounding = More [[compound interest]]
- Balance on which interest is paid
	- Large principle = More [[compound interest]]
- Interest rate applied
	- Higher APR = Higher EAR ([[compound interest]])
