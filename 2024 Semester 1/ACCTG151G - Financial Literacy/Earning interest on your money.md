- [[Interest rates (r)]] can be earned & paid in 3 ways:
	1. Some investments are sold on a discount basis
		- Investment sold for a price lower than redemption value
		- Difference between sales price & redemption value is the amount of interest earned
		 #acctg151Gexample - Treasury bill (T-bill)
		 - Government asks you to buy money cheaper for today's price specially
			 - Buying $1,000 for $900
	2. Other investments offer direct payment of interest to a 'savings' account
		- if you put into savings $\rightarrow$ you give up [[compound interest]]
	3. Still others allow for interest to be added to the principle balance in the savings account
