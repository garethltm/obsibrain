#acctg151Gexample 
$\frac {Total\ monthly\ loan\ payments}{Monthly\ income}$

Mortgage Interest $10,000 + Credit Card Interest $500 = $10,500
Wages (after tax) $40,000 + Interest $500 + Gifts $1,000 = $41,500
$\frac {10,500}{41,500}$ = 0.2530

- The lower this ratio, the less the difficulty in making monthly loan payments
- Lower ratio may mean:
	1. Lower Monthly payments OR
	2. Higher Income
- Mary's ratio is only 25% & would probably be considered at a manageable level

Some texts may use 'before-tax' income as the denominator
- We use after-tax as denominator in this course
