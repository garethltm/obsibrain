- a contract between yourself & a 3rd party

These are formal negotiated contracts which:
- Specify the terms for borrowing & repayment
- Specify interest cost & rate
- Specify any collateral security

Sometimes the fact that the contract (and the contractual payments) are to a 3rd-party finance company is not always obvious until the final paperwork is presented for signing

You need to be prepared to re-think the purchase at this point

If you have decent job (stable income) they won't require [[collateral security]]
