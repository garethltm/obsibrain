We've considered the [[Future Value (FV)]] of an [[Annuity]] (the target or end-result of a regular savings program) but sometimes we need to consider the [[Present Value (PV)]] of a future stream of payments.

This is the case when we look at paying off a loan (the amount of money we borrow today is the [[Present Value (PV)]] & [[Future Value (FV)]] is of course $0) and is simply the sum of [[Present Value (PV)]] of all the future [[Annuity]] cash-flows:

$PV = \frac {CF\tiny {1}}{(1+r)^1} + \frac {CF\tiny {2}}{(1+r)^2} +\frac {CF\tiny {3}}{(1+r)^3}+...+\frac {CF\tiny {n}}{(1+r)^n}$
often written as:
$PV = \displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^n \frac{CF\tiny t}{(1+r)^t}$
