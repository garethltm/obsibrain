- you do something today to plan your future
- A short-term [[Financial planning]] report that helps you achieve your short-term [[Financial Goals]]
- Achieving your short-term goals then helps you achieve your longer-term goals
- a forward looking plan

Regularly compare your budgeted figures to your actual figures each month & determine what the differences are & why they occurred (Variance Analysis).

Continually update your budget based upon the actual figures
- (this is meant to be a dynamic process)

Always try to keep your budget balanced or even better at a surplus
Surpluses are what we use to save for the future

## Benefits of Budgets
1. Monitor & Control finances
2. Allocate income to reach goals
3. Implement system of disciplined spending
4. Reduce or eliminate needless spending
5. Achieve long-term [[Financial Goals]]

### The budgeting process
1. Estimate Cash Inflows
	- this includes [[Income (Cash IN)]] from the income statement but also any other cash inflows such as borrowing money
2. Estimate Cash Outflows
	- this includes [[Expenses (Cash OUT)]] from the income statement but also any other cash outflows such as repaying loans

- Finalise the cash budget by subtracting cash outflows from cash inflows
- Deal with deficits (when outflows exceed inflows) & surpluses (when inflows exceed outflows)

## Conventions
- Budgets are usually constructed to cover periods of less than a year
- Very short budget periods (e.g. weekly) are to keep a tight control on cash-flows
	- this course we use budget periods of Monthly
- If you have information about weekly costs you should convert these into monthly equivalents
	- 52 weeks $\rightarrow$ 1 year $\rightarrow$ 1 year % 12 $\rightarrow$ Monthly
- If you have information about longer period costs (i.e quarterly, semi-annually or annually) DON'T convert them to monthly equivalents - place them in your budget in the month that they actually occur

## What you can do if you have monthly deficits
1. Try to economise to reduce [[Expenses (Cash OUT)]]
2. Shift [[Expenses (Cash OUT)]] from months with deficits to months with surpluses
3. Use savings or investments to cover temporary deficits
	- but try to make sure you replace the saving when the temporary cash-flow deficits is over
4. Use short-term borrowing to cover temporary deficits
	- borrowing from [[Banks (Commercial Banks)]]

## What should you do if you end the year in a deficit
1. Liquidate savings/investments
2. Borrow to cover the deficit
3. Cut low priority [[Expenses (Cash OUT)]] & alter spending habits
4. Increase [[Income (Cash IN)]]
