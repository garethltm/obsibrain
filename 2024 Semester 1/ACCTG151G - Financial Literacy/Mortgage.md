### Calculating the [[Mortgage]] payment
#acctg151Gexample What will the monthly mortgage payments be (P&I) on a $100,000, 30-year, 7% table-basis [[Mortgage]]? (annual rate)

The formula (and tables) requires the use of an [[Interest rates (r)]] that is relevant to the period being used.

The period is monthly:
$n = 30 years \times 12months/year = 360$

The [[Interest rates (r)]] per month:
$\frac {7\%p.a}{12} = 0.00583333$
	Note: Both are converted to monthly rates
