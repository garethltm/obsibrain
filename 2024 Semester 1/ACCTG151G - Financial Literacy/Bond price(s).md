The price of a bond is a function of its [[coupon rate]] (will affect the coupon payment you receive), time to maturity & the [[current]] market [[Interest rates (r)]] (affect the [[Bond price(s)]])
- [[Interest rates (r)]] & [[Bond price(s)]] move in opposite directions (are inversely related)
- Higher [[Interest rates (r)]] = Lower [[Bond price(s)]]

[[Bond price(s)]] is to discount all future cashflows to present $\rightarrow$ [[Present Value (PV)]]
