- Income Recognition = We have to recognise the transaction as long as the transaction occurs

Revenue & [[Expenses (Cash OUT)]] should be recognised in the [[Income Statement]] when they can be reliably measured & economic benefits have or will likely be transferred.
- As long as there is economic benefits we can recognise the transaction immediately
	[[Accrual Accounting]]
#### Why is it important to allocate revenue & expenses to the correct accounting period?
- This will give you an idea of the **actual occurring time** of those transactions

The accounting period assumption divides the life of a business up over several accounting periods.
- One of the potential use about those particular accounting information is to predict what is going to happen in the future

## Difference between [[Accrual Accounting]] & [[Cash Accounting]]

Profit differences could exist when:
- Service is performed/sale takes place, but cash will be collected in a future accounting period.
- Customer makes a deposit, but revenue won't be earned until a future accounting period. (from the company's perspective = company hasn't provided to customer)
	- Cash will increase because we receive money from customer
- The business incurs an expense that won't be paid until the next accounting period.
- The business pre-pays an expense that won't be used up until future accounting periods.
