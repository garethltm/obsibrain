[[2024 Semester 1/ACCTG151G - Financial Literacy/liquid asset]] [[asset(s)]]:
Bank balance $1,000 + Wages owed $1,500 = $2,500
[[current]] [[liability]]:
Unpaid electricity bill $1,000 + Credit card balance $3,000 = $4,000

$\frac{2,500}{4,000}= 0.625$
- The higher the ratio, the longer the existing [[2024 Semester 1/ACCTG151G - Financial Literacy/liquid asset]] [[asset(s)]] can cover the yearly committed obligations
- Mary could last about 8 months on her existing [[2024 Semester 1/ACCTG151G - Financial Literacy/liquid asset]] [[asset(s)]]
	- ***(0.625 * 12 = 8 months)***
