- without [[compounding]]
	- we don't consider interest

#acctg151Gexample
$1000 = principal (your own money)
10% is the fixed proportion of the principal
- your principal would be fixed = [[Fixed Interest Rates]]

$1000 @ 10% pa for 40 years
= Principal + (Interest $\times$ Periods)
= $1000 + (100 $\times$ 40)
= $1000 + $4000
= $5000

Interest for 1 year is only $100
## compound interest
![[compound interest#^d3a7bd]]
*you could get more from compound interest compared to simple interest*

*simple interest is not that good compared to [[compound interest]]*
