Short-term obligations
- [[current liability]]

$$Current\ Ratio=\frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}$$
- $Current\ Assets$
- $Current\ Liabilities$
to see the company's ability to cover its shorter obligations with its [[curr]]

If we are assessing liquidity by using the [[current]] [[Ratio]], does the composition of the [[current asset]] matter?
