Short-term obligations
- [[current liability]]

$$Current\ Ratio=\frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}$$
- $Current\ Assets$
- $Current\ Liabilities$
to see the company's ability to cover its shorter obligations with its [[current asset]]

If we are assessing liquidity by using the [[current]] [[Ratio]], does the composition of the [[current asset]] matter?

## Liquidity
$$Interest\ Cover=\frac {Earnings\ Before\ Interest\ \&\ Tax}{Interest\ Expense}$$
- [[Earnings Before Interest & Tax (EBIT)]] = [[Income Statement]]
- [[Interest expense]] = [[Income Statement]]

Increase in [[Earnings Before Interest & Tax (EBIT)]], for every $1 the company can pay the [[Interest expense]]

to see whether the company has enough profit to service the interest payment
- Before paying [[Interest expense]] to the debt holders & paying tax to government, we want to see how much money goes to the [[Interest expense]]
