### Understand Work Practice

	- Workarounds
- Defined methodology to gather & interpret
	- Needs detective work
##### Data Elicitation Steps
- Conduct a field visit to the customer
	- Observe & interview people while they use the existing product or system
	- Write research data notes as you encounter research data points
	- Gather artefacts associated with the work practice
	- Make sketches, diagrams or photos of the product or system in its physical environment![[Pasted image 20240326205323.png]]
## Requirements collection process
- During the collection phase you will formally identify:
	- People involved
	- Things they use
	- Processes involved
	- Information required
	- Constraints imposed
	- Inputs required
	- Outputs created
- You will then model the information by:
	- Creating descriptions of the people who do the work
	- Documenting the main use-cases
	- Creating different stories about how the various aspects of the work are done
	- Creating formal diagrams of the interaction
	- (Need a narrative)
## Preparation Prior to the visit
1. Learn about the subject domain
	- Culture of the work domain
	- Vocabulary, technical terms, slang, etc.
2. Learn about the company
	- Business goals, online presence for ethos, competition, best practice in domain, legacy systems
3. Learn about the proposed product or system
4. Decide on data sources
	- Subject matter experts, focus groups, user surveys, competitive analysis, become a domain expert
5. Visit parameters
	- How many visits, how many users, what user roles
## Exploring the Domain
- Understand the competition
	- Learn from othe rdesign solutions
