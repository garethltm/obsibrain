1. [[Understand needs]]


- Not about asking what users want
- More of: What users require from the system
	- Understand work practice
		- User work/user goals
		- User work practice
		- Work domain
	- You deduce design needs
### When to apply
- At the beginning
	- Of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
	- When writing new software
	- When evaluating software products
### Understand Work Practice
- A prerequisite to understanding needs
- A prelude for requirements
- UX designers need to develop this understanding
- Deep investigation of people's work
- Usually needs to be anonymous
## Discovery Phase
![[Pasted image 20240326204435.png]]
- Finding out about the work that people do
	- Visit their work context
	- Challenges & hurdles they face
	- Workarounds
- Defined methodology to gather & interpret
	- Needs detective work
##### Data Elicitation Steps
- Conduct a field visit to the customer
	- Observe & interview people while they use the existing product or system
	- Write research data notes as you encounter research data points
	- Gather artefacts associated with the work practice
	- Make sketches, diagrams or photos of the product or system in its physical environment![[Pasted image 20240326205323.png]]
1. [[Collection - Elicitation]]
2. [[Collection - Observation]]
## Requirements collection process
- During the collection phase you will formally identify:
	- People involved
	- Things they use
	- Processes involved
	- Information required
	- Constraints imposed
	- Inputs required
	- Outputs created
- You will then model the information by:
	- Creating descriptions of the people who do the work
	- Documenting the main use-cases
	- Creating different stories about how the various aspects of the work are done
	- Creating formal diagrams of the interaction
	- (Need a narrative)
## Preparation Prior to the visit (1)
1. Learn about the subject domain
	- Culture of the work domain
		- ## Exploring the Domain
		- Understand the competition
			- Learn from other design solutions
			- Assess both the positive & negative aspects
			- Respect copyrighted material & intellectual property
		***NOTE: Often times the goal is to not build a new system but to buy a system that best fits***
	- Vocabulary, technical terms, slang, etc.
2. Learn about the company
	- Business goals, online presence for ethos, competition, best practice in domain, legacy systems
3. Learn about the proposed product or system
4. Decide on data sources
	- Subject matter experts, focus groups, user surveys, competitive analysis, become a domain expert
5. Visit parameters
	- How many visits, how many users, what user roles
## Preparation Prior to the visit (2)
1. Organise a data elicitation team
2. Recruit participants
	- Rely on client to help
	- Recruit locally for consumer products
	- Good coverage for work roles
3. Identify setting for study
4. Observe users in their work context
5. Ensure no influence by management
6. Prepare initial questions
## During the visit
1. Set the stage
	- Rapport with client, explain purpose, explain approach
2. Observation versus interviewing
	- Idea of making things feel more natural (not everything has to be interviewed)
3. Successful data elicitation
	- Listen to what the user says is needed
	- Partner with users
	- Be a good listener & good detective
	- Avoid interjecting your own views
4. What to look for - specific information
	- User work roles
	- User personas
	- Input to user stories & requirements
	- Work practice artefacts
	- Flow of information & artefacts
	- User tasks
	- Physical work environment
	- Information architecture
	- Photo ops
5. What to look for - general information
	- Surprises, Emotional & social aspects
6. Capture the data
7. Connection to data sources (using IDs)
8. Write good raw data notes
