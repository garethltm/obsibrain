As you create each [[User eXperience (UX)]] problem description, think not only of the user but also the [[User eXperience (UX)]] team. This means including enough information to make the [[User eXperience (UX)]] problem description as useful as possible for data analysis so team members can:
1. Understand the problem in its usage context
2. Glean insight into its causes & possible solutions
3. Be conscious of relationships among similar problems
4. Come up with suitable redesign solutions
