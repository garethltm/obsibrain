In addition to strictly specified benchmark and unmeasured tasks, the evaluator may also find it useful to observe the participant in informal interaction with the design, a free-play period without the constraints of predefined tasks. This does not necessarily mean that they are even doing [[Tasks]], maybe just exploring.

To engage a participant in free use, the evaluator might simply say "play around with the interface for a while, doing anything you would like to, and talk aloud while you are playing." Free use is valuable for revealing participant expectations and system behavior in situations not anticipated by designers, often situations that can break a poor design.
