- a problem on the qualitative side

In simple terms, the reliability of a [[Empirical UX Evaluation Methods]] means repeatability & it's a problem with both empirical & analytical methods. 
- It means that, if you use the same formative evaluation method with several different user participants (for [[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI345 - Human-computer Interaction/empirical|empirical]] methods) or several different [[User eXperience (UX)]] inspectors (for analytic methods), you won't get the same list of [[User eXperience (UX)]] problems each time.
- In fact, the differences can be fairly large. We have to live with imperfect reliability.
The good news is that even [[User eXperience (UX)]] evaluation methods & techniques with low reliability can still be very effective - #compsci345example the methods still find [[User eXperience (UX)]] problems that need fixing & often they find the most important problems. 

Low reliability is not always a serious drawback; much of each iteration of formative evaluation in [[User eXperience (UX)]] practice is about learning as much as the design as you can at the lowest cost & then moving on.
