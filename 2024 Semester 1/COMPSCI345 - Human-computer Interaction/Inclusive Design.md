A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity (recognising diversity)
- It is to include users that feel excluded

### Who we design for
As a designer, we often decide based on our own abilities and biases. This means we end up designing for people of a specific gender, age, language ability, technology literacy, and physical ability.

### Who gets excluded
Understand that there is no such thing as a "normal" user
If we assume that normal = perceiving with all 5 senses, we are ignoring much of the range of humanity.![[Pasted image 20240423173654.png]]
