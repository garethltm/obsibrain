A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity (recognising & acknowledging diversity)
- It is to include users that feel excluded
### Who we design for
As a designer, we often decide based on our own abilities and biases. This means we end up designing for people of a specific gender, age, language ability, technology literacy, and physical ability.
### Who gets excluded
Understand that there is no such thing as a "normal" user
If we assume that normal = perceiving with all 5 senses, we are ignoring much of the range of humanity.![[Pasted image 20240423173654.png]]
### Normal = Average
If you design for average, you design for no one. (as not one is at the same dimension)
- It is not difficult to design something that's customizable while keeping the cost minimum
### Why is it important?
It allows us to make a great product for the greatest number of people
Our designs should reflect diversity, as nobody is constant: everyone changes & adapts to the context around them
In other words, barrier to participation should always be low so more can participate

- [[Universal]]
- [[Assistive]]
- [[Accessible]]
- [[Usable]]

It is important to understand that there is no clear divide between the terms. There are overlaps and they function together.
- Everyone can get through a door
- Door handle easy to grasp
- Door dimensions can fit anyone
- Door is automatic
- A long reach door opener
## Principles of [[Inclusive Design]]
1. [[Recognize Exclusion]]
2. [[Learn From Diversity]]
3. [[Solve for one, extend to many]]
There are actually many other documented principles from various sources. 
- Be equitable
- Be flexible
- Be straightforward
- Be perceptible
- Be informative
- Be preventive
- Be tolerant
- Be effortless
- Be accommodating
- Be consistent
## Benefits of [[Inclusive Design]]
1. Increased access - more users can use your design
2. Reduced friction - less barrier for users
3. More emotional context - your design can be empathized by many (emotionally attachment is very strong)
## Skills of a successful inclusive designer
1. Can identify ability biases & mismatched interactions between people and world
2. Can create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience
3. Can design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together
## What is the difference between [[diversity]] and [[inclusion]]?
It's like the difference between hearing and listening

Hearing $\rightarrow$ You perceive the sound but you don't understand the context
Listening $\rightarrow$ Paying attention and actually understanding the message

***"Inclusion implies a diverse group of people feeling like they belong. Diversity just means a group of different people, but not necessarily feeling like they belong"***
