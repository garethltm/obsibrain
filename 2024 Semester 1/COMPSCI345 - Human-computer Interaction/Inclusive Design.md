A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity (recognising & acknowledging diversity)
- It is to include users that feel excluded
### Who we design for
As a designer, we often decide based on our own abilities and biases. This means we end up designing for people of a specific gender, age, language ability, technology literacy, and physical ability.
### Who gets excluded
Understand that there is no such thing as a "normal" user
If we assume that normal = perceiving with all 5 senses, we are ignoring much of the range of humanity.![[Pasted image 20240423173654.png]]
### Normal = Average
If you design for average, you design for no one. (as not one is at the same dimension)
- It is not difficult to design something that's customizable while keeping the cost minimum
### Why is it important?
It allows us to make a great product for the greatest number of people
Our designs should reflect diversity, as nobody is constant: everyone changes & adapts to the context around them
In other words, barrier to participation should always be low so more can participate
