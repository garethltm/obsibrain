- In collaboration with Rolf Molich, Jakob Nielsen developed a set of 10 heuristics for interface design (1990 - 1994)
- The revised set based on an analysis of 249 [[Usability]] problems

1. [[Visibility of System Status]]
2. [[Match between System & the Real World]]
3. User Control & Freedom
	- Clearly marked exit
	- Undo/redo
4. Consistency & Standards
	- Follow platform conventions
	- Terminology stays constant
5. Error Prevention
	- Remove error-prone conditions
	- Check for errors, get user confirmation
6. [[Recognition Rather Than Recall]]
7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use
	- Add accelerators for expert users
8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design
	- Remove irrelevant, or rarely needed information
9. Help Users to:
	1. Recognise
	2. Diagnose
	3. Recover from Errors
	- Error messages in plain language, suggest a solution
10. Help & Documentation
	- Easy to search, focused on the task, details concrete steps to carry out
