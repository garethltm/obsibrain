1. Evaluation methods & techniques
	 - #### [[Usage Testing]]
		 - to identify problems before too costly to fix
		 ##### When to do we do it?
		 - Early & often - from initial design to late stages
		 - [[Usage Testing]] plans involve carefully choosing tasks & writing scenarios/prompts
		 - [[Usage Testing]] protocols include what you say, what you'll observe/record & what you'll do (eg., give a [[Questionnaires]])
