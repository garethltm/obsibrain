Never say "I think", always back it up with data "Based on"
## Goal
1. To learn how to design controlled experiments to be analyzed [[quantitative]]ly
2. To know the important terms of experiment design
3. To understand the different variables & how they form an experiment
## What is an experiment in HCI context?
In HCI, we often want to determine:
1. Which interface is better?
2. Which interaction is better?
3. Which design is better?
4. Which process is better?
5. How is it better?
6. Why is it better?
It is to show how the manipulation of a variable has another direct causal influence on another variable. It is the notion of causality.
## [[A B Testing]]
- comparing 2 elements
## Advantages of Experiment
1. It's data, not just opinion
2. We don't only know which is better but what makes it better
3. It's a systematic process, allowing results to be generalized
- A good experiment would cover both [[quantitative]] & [[qualitative]]
## 4 stages of an Experiment

1. [[Defining a research question or problem statement]]
2. Hypothesis formulation
