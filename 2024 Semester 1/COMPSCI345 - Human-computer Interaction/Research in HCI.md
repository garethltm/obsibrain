Never say "I think", always back it up with data "Based on"
## Goal
1. To learn how to design controlled experiments to be analyzed quantitatively
2. To know the important terms of experiment design
3. To understand the different variables & how they form an experiment
## What is an experiment in HCI context?
In HCI, we often want to determine:
1. Which interface is better?
2. Which interaction is better?
3. Which design is better?
4. Which process is better?
5. How is it better?
6. Why is it better?
It is to show how the manipulation of a variable has another direct causal influence on another
