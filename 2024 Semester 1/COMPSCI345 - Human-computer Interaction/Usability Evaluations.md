- Evaluation is an integral part of the development process & can take the form of an informal [[Design Walkthrough]] or more structured [[Heuristic evaluation(s)]]
- Formal usability testing can begin once a [[prototype]] has been developed
- Evaluation of an existing system is often part of the analysis stage
- ==Starting the evaluation process early== in the design phase fosters better design because decisions can be tested before it is too expensive to make changes

## Types of [[Usability]] Evaluations
- [[Performance Measurement(s)]]
