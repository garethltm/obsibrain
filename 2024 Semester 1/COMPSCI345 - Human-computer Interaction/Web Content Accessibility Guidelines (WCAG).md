- these are first published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2008 to assist web developers in creating accessible web sites.
### 3 WCAG levels
1. A
2. AA
3. AAA
with level AA being the most commonly used by industry (we should look to conform to AA as the normal standard)
## Web font size
#### Goal:
- readability of font in a typical usage scenario
#### Challenge:
- differences in devices, interaction of user settings (Zoom level) and font size
#### Solution strategies:
- Explicit font size setting: 16px as frequent recommendation
- Using standard settings #compsci345example of established frameworks. 
- Font size setting #compsci345example for paragraphs is expected to be acceptable
## Colour Contrast
- Many users cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between text & background, #compsci345example  light gray text on a light background![[Pasted image 20240520135029.png]]
#### Readability is helped with larger size
1. If text < 18pt or < **14pt(bold)**, then 4:5:1 contrast
2. If text $\ge$ 18pt or $\ge$ **14pt(bold)**, then 3:1 contrast
1pt = 0.75px
#### Functional Colour
- Functional Colour use is where colours transmit important information (traffic light colours)
- Functional Colour should be used additionally to other representations of the information
#compsci345example In markers on these slides we use cross & ticks where the colours are only repeating the information already given by the symbols![[Pasted image 20240520135513.png]]
