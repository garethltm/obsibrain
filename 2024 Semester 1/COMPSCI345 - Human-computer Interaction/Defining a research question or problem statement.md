- What is the problem?
	- Establish what is the issue
- Why should anyone care?

### Start with something general or simple (a comparison):
#compsci345example 
- "is a smart watch better than a mechanical wrist watch?"
- "is an Android phone better than an Iphone?"
- "is Ebay better than Freecycle?"
### Then be a bit more specific:
#compsci345example 
- "How is a smart watch more accurate than a mechanical wrist watch in telling the time?"
- "How is an Android phone more responsive than an Iphone?"
- "How is Ebay more usable to purchase things compared to Freecycle?"
### At this point, we should think...how do we measure what we intend to know about?
- "How to measure the accuracy of time telling?"
	- a timegrapher could potentially be used
- "How to measure phone responsivenes?"
	- measure delay using high-speed camera
- "How to measure website [[Usability]]?
	- fill a [[Usability]] [[Questionnaires]]"
	- The question should be:
		1. Clearly defined (not too general)
		2. Feasible (won't take too long, too expensive to carry out, )
