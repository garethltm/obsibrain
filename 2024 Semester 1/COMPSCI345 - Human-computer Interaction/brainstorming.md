- Team activity
	- Get out possible ideas, explore the solution space
		- Minimize critical thinking at this stage
		- Any idea is 'good enough' to write down
		- Explore beyond the obvious
		- "Worst possible idea" approach
	- May use storyboarding
		- Making a comic strip of the interaction concept
		- Any sort of diagramming that denotes the idea
	- (Easier to tone down a wild idea than to think up a new one)
- Teams can work in parallel by breaking into subgroups or individually, to scribble ideas on paper sheets or post-its
	- Useful to build on other's ideas
	- Want to have a variety in group makeup
	- Mediated, only one conversation at a time
	- Ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute
- [[Brainstorming]] sessions generate a lot of material that must then be filtered & organized
