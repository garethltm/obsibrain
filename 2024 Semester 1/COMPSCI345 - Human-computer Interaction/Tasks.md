- Utterly central to what you will learn in the [[Usage Testing]]
- There just isn't time/resources to do [[Usage Testing]] on everything
- Select the tasks that are 'make-or-break' for the application
- You are looking for 
	1. what's important, related to [[User eXperience (UX)]] goals
	2. risk
		- What's novel? What will differentiate this product? 
			- not novel would mean not much testing because you can expect for a certain target population that they're familiar
		- What's potentially weak?
		- If you're in a 'safe' zone where you're emulating well-established interaction patterns, then you'll learn less
			- then again, still can be important to check that you got it right
**say what to do but not how to do it**
- give them a goal & not tell them anything about the interface $\rightarrow$ actually testing without interference

## Task Design
- Prioritise [[Tasks]] that are crucial
- Craft the specific language that the user will hear or read
	- use normal language, no hints about your interface
