- The distribution of the optical weight in an interface
	- Perception that some objects appear heavier than others
	- #compsci345example larger objects, cluster of small objects, objects with strong, intense colours
- The balance in screen design is achieved by providing an equal 'weight' of screen elements, left & right, top & bottom

## 2 common systems
1. Symmetry - a mirror image

	- Symmetry can occur in any orientation as long as the elements are the same on either side of the central axis
	- Also called formal balance because a form (formula) is used
2. Asymmetry - without symmetry
3.
