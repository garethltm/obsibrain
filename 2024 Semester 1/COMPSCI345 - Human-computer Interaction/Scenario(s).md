- a description in 'plain English' of a typical task
- Describes:
	- The basic goal
	- The conditions that exist at the beginning of the task
	- The activities in which the persona will engage
	- The outcomes of those activities
- Paired with a [[User Personas]]
- We pair it with a PACT structure:
	- People
	- Activities
	- Context
	- Technology
- A [[Scenario(s)]] should be 'situated' with 1 or more of your [[User Personas]]
	- You visualise Suzie being the end user working through that [[Scenario(s)]]
	- How do you interpret the [[Scenario(s)]] differently if it starts:
		- 'The guidance counsellor'
		- 'Suzie'
- A [[Scenario(s)]] should specify the interface details as little as possible
	- They are much more about what's getting done as compared to how the user is manipulating the system to do it
	- A good design will be the one that makes the [[Scenario(s)]] task activity natural & efficient for our [[User Personas]]
