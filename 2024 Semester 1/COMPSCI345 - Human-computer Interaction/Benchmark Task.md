As a measuring instrument for an objective [[User eXperience (UX)]] measure, a [[Benchmark Task]] is a representative task that you will have user participants attempt to accomplish in evaluation while you observer their performance & behaviour.

As such, a [[Benchmark Task]] is a "standardized" task that can be used to compare performance among different users & across different design versions
- testing on different releases/versions
