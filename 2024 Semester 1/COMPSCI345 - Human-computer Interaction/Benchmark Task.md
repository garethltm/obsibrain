As a measuring instrument for an objective [[User eXperience (UX)]] measure, a [[Benchmark Task]] is representative [[Tasks]] that you will have user participants attempt to accomplish in evaluation while you observe their performance & behaviour.

As such, a [[Benchmark Task]] is a "standardized" task that can be used to compare performance among different users & across different design versions
- testing on different releases/versions

[[Benchmark Task]] for the Ticket Kiosk System
- As another example, a [[Benchmark Task]] might require users to buy 4 tickets for a concert under a total of $200 while showing tickets in this price range for the upcoming few days as sold out. 
- This would force users to perform the task of searching through other future concert days, looking for the 1st available day with tickets in this price range
