## Direct
1. Interviews
	- On-site interviews: may help people remember aspects of the job
	- Away from job site interviews: not interrupted by normal work related events
2. Focus groups
	- Require a moderator/facilitator to keep discussion on track
	- Maintain spontaneity (acting without thinking)
	- Have clearly defined outcomes
	- Provide participants with a context for the project
	- Work best if the participants have a 'peer' relationship
		- If line workers won't speak freely in front of line supervisors, then put them into 2 separate focus groups
