- [[Replicability]]
- [[Know your sample]]
- [[Ethical Considerations]]
	### Other considerations
	1. Run a pilot study prior to your "actual" study
	2. Take breaks. Your participants are only humans
	3. Let them train with your system as an initial step if it's a novel system
	4. Keep it simple. The more complex the experiment design, the harder it
