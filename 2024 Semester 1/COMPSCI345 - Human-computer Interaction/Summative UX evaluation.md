is defined to be UX evaluation with the objective to sum up/assess the success of a UX design

| Randomly chosen subjects/participants                                    | Deliberately non-random participant selection to get most formative information |
| Concerned with having large enough sample size (number of subjects)      | Deliberately uses relatively small number of participants                       |
| Uses rigorous & powerful statistical techniques                          | Deliber                                                                         |
| Results can be used to make claims about "truth" in a scientific sense   |                                                                                 |
| Relatively expensive & time consuming to perform                         |                                                                                 |

| Tends to yield "truth" about very specific scientific questions (A vs B) |                                                                                 |
| Not used within a UX design process                                      |                                                                                 |
