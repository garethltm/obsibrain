is defined to be UX evaluation with the objective to sum up/assess the success of a UX design

| Randomly chosen subjects/participants                                    | Deliberately non-random participant selection to get most formative information                         |
| Concerned with having large enough sample size (number of subjects)      | Deliberately uses relatively small number of participants                                               |
| Uses rigorous & powerful statistical techniques                          | Deliberately simple, low-power statistical techniques (eg. simple mean & sometimes, standard deviation) |
| Results can be used to make claims about "truth" in a scientific sense   | Results cannot be used to make claims, but are used to make engineering judgements                      |
| Relatively expensive & time consuming to perform                         | Relatively inexpensive & rapid to perform                                                               |
| Rigorous constraints on methods & procedures                             | Methods & procedures open to innovation & adaptation                                                    |
| Tends to yield "truth" about very specific scientific questions (A vs B) | Can                                                                                                     |
| Not used within a UX design process                                      |                                                                                                         |
