Your goal would be to REJECT the [[Null Hypothesis (Ho)]], because you want to say "Yes, there is a difference"
- In other words, we also gather more support for the [[Alternative Hypothesis (Ha or H1)]]

Why can't we just say "The hypothesis is proven?"
- because the hypothesis is never truly proven
We cannot say with absolute certainty, that A is better than B at all accounts.
BUT
We can say that A is not the same as B (reject [[Null Hypothesis (Ho)]])

"The hypothesis is supported" $\rightarrow$ try to say this and not say "We reject the null hypothesis"
