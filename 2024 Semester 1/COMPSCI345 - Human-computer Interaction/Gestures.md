- driving functionalities of [[Virtual Reality (VR)]], [[Augmented Reality (AR)]] through [[Gestures]]
## Objectives
1. Understand what types of gestures exist
2. Survey gesture technologies
3. Understand approaches to developing gestures
## Gesture-based Interactions
1. [[Gestures]] - this would be useful in certain environments like construction
	- Air-tap
	- Tap-and-hold
	- Hand cursor
2. Intuitive gestures
3. Memorable gestures
4. Non-straining
## Ease vs Expressiveness
- Keyboard - expressive but not easy
- Mouse - easy but not expressive
	- ##### Mouse Gestures![[Pasted image 20240522222834.png]]
- "Natural User Interfaces (NUI)" - easy & expressive
## [[Gestures]] Limitations
