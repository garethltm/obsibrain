- driving functionalities of [[Virtual Reality (VR)]], [[Augmented Reality (AR)]] through [[Gestures]]
## Objectives
1. Understand what types of gestures exist
2. Survey gesture technologies
3. Understand approaches to developing gestures
## Gesture-based Interactions
1. [[Gestures]] - this would be useful in certain environments like construction
	- Air-tap
	- Tap-and-hold
	- Hand cursor
2. Intuitive gestures
3. Memorable gestures
4. Non-straining
## Ease vs Expressiveness
- Keyboard - expressive but not easy
- Mouse - easy but not expressive
	- ##### Mouse Gestures![[Pasted image 20240522222834.png]]
- "Natural User Interfaces (NUI)" - easy & expressive
## [[Gestures]] Limitations
- Little relationship between operations
- Commands must be sequential
-  Hard to refer to previous operations
- Arbitrary order of operations
## Types of [[Gestures]]
#### Gesture Styles
- Deictic (pointing at things) - can be seem as rude in certain cultures
- Gesticulation (talking, moving around)
- Manipulation (analogue of the real world - mapping the movement to manipulate the virtual world)
- Semaphores (positions)
- Sign Language
#### Technologies
- Perceptual
	- Vision
	- Audio
	- Remote sensing
- Non-Perceptual
	- Data gloves
	- Pens
	- Mouse/Joystick
	- Touch surfaces
	- Tangible devices
## Video/Vision Costs/Benefits
- User adaptability & [[feedback]]
	- fixed palette of [[Gestures]], or adapt during use
- Learnability
	- Learning rate & memorability for users
	- Performance versus [[Gestures]] set size
- Accuracy
	- Hand within the camera view, moving, occluded, shape, colour
	- Gestures designed for camera accuracy versus intuitive![[Pasted image 20240522225627.png]]
	**More [[Gestures]] can mean higher error rate**
	- **[[Gestures]] need to be different from each other for better recognition rate**
- Low mental load
	- Recalling [[Gestures]] & trajectory adds to load
	- Short & natural [[Gestures]]
- Intuitiveness
	- Clear cognitive association with [[Tasks]]
	- No complex shapes & unnatural combinations
	- Tied to cultural background, no commonality![[Pasted image 20240522230126.png]]
- Comfort
	- Avoid requiring intense muscle tension - "Gorilla Arm" syndrome
		- Holding a pose out for too long can cause fatigue
	- No awkward repetitive [[Gestures]]
- Lexicon size & multi-hand systems
	- Single hand, dual hand, arm, body
	- Recogniser for small number of [[Gestures]] is best
- Come as you are 
	- How encumbered can the user, be & in what environment
		- do you need special setup
	- Impact on setup
	- IR for near, far, ultrasonic, other imagers
- Reconfigurability
	- Not providing a huge palette to start, but modifying the palette
	- Modify palette for different [[Tasks]]
- Interaction space
	- Where can [[Gestures]] be recognised (virtual interaction envelope)
	- Stereo vision is best, but possible for mobile platforms?
- [[Gestures]] spotting & immersion syndrome
		- Unintended movement recognition - Midas Touch proble
	- Cue selection approaches (voice, buttons, [[Gestures]])
- Ubiquity & wearability
	- Small sensors & cameras placed where on the body
