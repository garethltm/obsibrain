User Experience Goals for the Ticket Kiosk System
- from our usage research data, we can define the primary high-level [[User eXperience (UX)]] goals for the ticket buyer to include:
	- Fast & easy walk-up & use user experience, with absolutely no user training
	- Fast learning so new user performance (after limited experience) is on par with that of an experienced user.
	- High customer satisfaction leading to high rate of repeat customers
- Some other possibilities:
	- High learnability for more advanced tasks
	- Draw, engagement, attraction
	- Low error rate for completing transactions correctly, especially in the interaction for payment
