- combines real & virtual objects in a real environment
- Registers (aligns) real & virtual objects with each other
- Runs interactively, in 3D, in real time - which can give you motion sickness
- Putting information into a reality that doesn't exist
## Main issue
- How do we register things that are actually placed in the real world (mapping)![[Pasted image 20240522214725.png]]
## Enabling Technologies
### 1. Displays
