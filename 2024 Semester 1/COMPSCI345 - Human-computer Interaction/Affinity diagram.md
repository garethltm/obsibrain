	- grouping brainstorming ideas
	- grouping comments from users
	- analysing problems observed/reported by users

### Considerations
1. The Affinity is built bottom-up (inductive)
2. 'We don't start with known categories such as 'Quality' that might be familiar to the team
3. Keep group notes small: 4-6 notes per group
	- Make more groups, finding more issues or more insights
4. Label each group - use a different colour for labels
	- Group into hierarchical structure that breaks the data about the topic/user into manageable chunks
