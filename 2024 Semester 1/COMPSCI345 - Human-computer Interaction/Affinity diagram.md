1. A tool for organizing field data & consolidating insights from collected data
	- common technique to find recurring patterns/themes
2. Arranges the notes from interpretation sessions into a hierarchy that reveals common issues an themes across all users
3. Can be used for many purposes
	- consolidating information from contextual inquiry
	- grouping brainstorming ideas
	- grouping comments from users
	- analysing problems observed/reported by users

### Considerations
1. The Affinity is built bottom-up (inductive)
2. 'We don't start with known categories such as 'Quality' that might be familiar to the team
3. Keep group notes small: 4-6 notes per group
	- Make more groups, finding more issues or more insights
4. Label each group - use a different colour for labels
	- Group into hierarchical structure that breaks the data about the topic/user into manageable chunks

### Process
Important:
- To start with the project/research focus:
	- The meaning a team reads in a note & the way they group them are driven by the project/research focus
- To let groups emerge, rather than start with predefined groups

1. Record each idea/observation/problem/etc. on an individual card or sticky note (in random order).
2. In team, arrange the notes into a hierarchy
	- Look for notes that seem to be related
	- Sort notes into groups until all used
	- Give them a label representing the insight suggested by the group
		- The label is the synthesis of the detailed data
		- Labels written from user's perspective
		- Labels will drive design
	- Sort & re-sort into larger clusters subgroups as necessary
	***NOTE: Place notes one at a time; as each note is placed, other team members may add similar notes in close proximity***
3. Look to split up large groups
	- Find sub-topics - forming the hierarchy![[Pasted image 20240326221251.png]]

### How far do you take the analysis
- as far as is helpful for your needs

1. Useful until you have uncovered with some rigor,
