1. Step through the [[Tasks]] yourself
	- Record different routes to successfully complete the task'
	- Time yourself
2. Note things you think are difficult or confusing
	- You are, in effect, doing a Heuristic Evaluation
	- Remember these are your perceptions/actions (users will surprise you)
	- DO NOT show this to participants
- A design & heuristic walkthrough before user testing $\rightarrow$ gives you a view on what are important tasks & potential [[usabili ]]
