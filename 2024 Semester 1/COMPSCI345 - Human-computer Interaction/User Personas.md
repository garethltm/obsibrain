- Align with work roles
- Personas should be a reflection of the information derived from the data collection activities
	- Should be able to point to a direct one-to-one relation with an observed user behavior or statement

		- You need to have enough there to inform the design decisions
		- You have to be able to identify with them as if they were a real person
	- Can be a synthesis of characteristics observed over multiple users/potential users

- A name (Preferably a photo)
- Goals & motivating forces
- Behaviours & a personality
- Any relevant background
	- #compsci345example
