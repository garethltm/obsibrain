- Personas are archetypes of actual users, defined by the user's goals & attributes
- Align with work roles
- Personas should be a reflection of the information derived from the data collection activities
	- Should be able to point to a direct one-to-one relation with an observed user behavior or statement
		- Otherwise, may be erroneous & will lead to incorrect design decisions
	- Yet you have to make them 3-dimensional
		- You need to have enough there to inform the design decisions
		- You have to be able to identify with them as if they were a real person
	- Can be a synthesis of characteristics observed over multiple users/potential users

Expected to have:
- A name (Preferably a photo)
- Goals & motivating forces
- Behaviours & a personality
- Any relevant background
	- #compsci345example 
	- their past experience with other software (& how they felt about it)

They should be a '3-dimensional' person that can serve as a reference
- "Will this work for Tim?"

## Advantages of personas
1. They are quick & easy to create
2. They provide a consistent model for all team members
3. They are easy to use with other design methods
4. They make the user "real" in the mind of the designer
	- #compsci345example 
	- a basis for our 'empathy' as designers

## Disadvantages of personas
1. They can be difficult to create if the target audience is international (or just diverse in whatever way)
2. Having too many personas will make the work difficult
	- 6-8 is the usual amount
3. There is a risk of incorporating unsupported designer assumptions
