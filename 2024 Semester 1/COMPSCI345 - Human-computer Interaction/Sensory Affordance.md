## 1. Visual
- it is about the presentation of user interfaces. 
	- this includes 
	1. visibility
		- based on the degree of importance - the more important, the more visible it should be; It should not be blocked & not require additional actions to make it visible![[Pasted image 20240522202844.png]]
	2. noticeability
		- when something is visible but noticeable - basically means you can see it, but it doesn't demand your focus![[Pasted image 20240522203212.png]]

	6. color
		- the use of color to deliver a message, whether to make an object or its interaction stand out more - closely related to color psychology![[Pasted image 20240522203429.png]]
