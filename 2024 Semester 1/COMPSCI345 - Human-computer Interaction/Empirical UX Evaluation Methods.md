- [[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI345 - Human-computer Interaction/empirical|empirical]] methods, by definition, depend on data observed in the performance of real user participants & data coming directly from user participants. These data include critical incident data observed in [[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI345 - Human-computer Interaction/empirical|empirical]] evaluation & comments from users (verbalisation from the users) while "thinking aloud" &/or in their questionnaire responses
## Objective [[User eXperience (UX)]] measures (directly measurable by evaluators):
1. Initial performance
	- How the user uses it for the first time
2. Long-term performance (longitudinal, experienced, steady state) 
	- How they use it over time
3. Learnability
4. Retainability
5. Advanced feature usage
