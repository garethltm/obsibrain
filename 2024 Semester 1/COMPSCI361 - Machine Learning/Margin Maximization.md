Given a set of linearly separable [[training data]] $S = \{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}, y_i \in \{+1, -1\}$
We want to find a [[hyperplane]]) 
There is an infinite number of lines (hyperplanes) separating the 2 classes

## Goal
The [[Hard-margin (SVMs)]] algorithms aims to find a linear [[classifier(s)]] that maximises ($\gamma$) the margin on $S$
- We want to find the one that is as far away as possible from the [[training data]] 
	- largest margin from the middle [[hyperplane]]
