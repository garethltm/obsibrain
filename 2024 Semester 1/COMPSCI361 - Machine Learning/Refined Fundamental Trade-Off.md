- Let $E_{best}$ be the [[irreducible error]]
	- #compsci361example - [[irreducible error]] for predicting coin flips is 0.5
- Some [[Learning Theory]] results use $E_{best}$ to further decompose $E_{test}$![[Pasted image 20240312222435.png]]
- This is similar to the [[bias-variance decomposition]]
## [[Decision Tree(s)]] with high depth
- Very likely to fit data well, so bias is low
- But model changes a lot if you change the data, so variance is high
## [[Decision Tree(s)]] with low depth
- Less likely to fit data well, so bias is high
- But model does not change much if you change the data, so variance is low
## And degree does not effect [[irreducible error]]
- [[irreducible error]]
