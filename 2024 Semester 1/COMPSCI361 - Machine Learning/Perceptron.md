## Architecture
It is possible to have multiple structures of neurons
![[Pasted image 20240606142350.png]]
- Network topology
- Number of units in the input layer
- Number of hidden layers (if > 1)
- Number of units in each hidden layer
- Number of connections between layers
- Number of units in the output layer
## Function
- maps input to output
- contains [[parameters]] to be learned
### [[Activation Function]]
- to control output of neurons to a certain range
- Applied to the weighted sum$
\sum_{j} w_{j}x_{j} + b
