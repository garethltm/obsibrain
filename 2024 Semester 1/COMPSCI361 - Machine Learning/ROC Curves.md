- ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves
	- for visual comparisons of classification models

- Originated from signal detection theory
- Shows the trade-off between:
	- true positive rate TPR = $\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
	- false positive rate FPR = $\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$
- how many negatives labelled as positives

The area under the [[ROC Curves]] (AUC: Area Under Curve, also AUROC) is a measure of the accuracy of the model

Rank the test tuples in decreasing order:
- the one that is most likely to belong to the positive class appears at the top
