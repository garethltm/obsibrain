- The [[Decision Tree(s)]] depth is called a [[hyperparameters]]
	- [[hyperparameters]] control how complex our model is
	- We can't train a [[hyperparameters]]
		- You can always fit [[training data]] better by making the model more complicated
	- We validate a [[hyperparameters]] using a validation score
