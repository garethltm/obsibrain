- The [[Decision Tree(s)]] depth is called a [[hyperparameters]]
	- [[hyperparameters]] control how complex our model is
	- We can't train a [[hyperparameters]]
		- You can always fit [[training data]] better by making the model more complicated
	- We validate a [[hyperparameters]] using a validation score

## Choosing [[hyperparameters]] with validation sets
- So to choose a good value of depth ([[hyperparameters]]), we coould
	1. Try a depth-1 decision tree, compute [[Validation Error]]
	2. Try a depth-2 decision tree, compute [[v]]
