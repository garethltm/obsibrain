generate synthetic data
- make more data (increase the size of the [[training data]]) $\rightarrow$ to combat [[overfit(ting)]]

[[overfit(ting)]] can happen if you do not have enough data to train all [[parameters]]

Pre-processing technic $\rightarrow$ does not modify explicitly the learning algorithm
- Increases the [[training data]] set size
- Increases the diversity of the data
- Especially used with images
This includes operations like rotating the image, flipping, scaling, adding [[Noise]], etc.
## However
this can lead to underfitting if generate
