Chi-merge: $\chi  ^2$-based [[Discretization]]
- [[Supervised Learning]]: use class information
- Bottom-up merge: find the best neighbouring intervals (those having similar distributions of classes #compsci361example low $\chi ^2$ values) to merge
- Merge performed recursively, until a predefined stopping conditio
