[[Confusion Matrix]]
[[F-measure]]

1. Classifier accuracy or recognition rate
	- Percentage of test set tuples that are correctly classified
	- $Accuracy = \frac{(TP + TN)}{All}$
2. [[Precision (Exactness)]]
3. [[Recall (Completeness)]]
- There is an inverse relationship between [[Precision (Exactness)]] & [[Recall (Completeness)]]
