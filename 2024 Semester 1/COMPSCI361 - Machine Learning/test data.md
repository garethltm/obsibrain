- **to ensure the model works for the given testing data**. 
- The testing data should meet two criteria: 
	- It should represent the actual dataset that the model will be used on. This means that the testing data should have the same distribution of features as the actual dataset.
	- It should be large enough to generate meaningful predictions. This means the testing data should be large enough to provide a statistically significant test of the modelâ€™s performance.
