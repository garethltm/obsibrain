- Will never achieve total zero errors on all unseen test set
1. Optimal error rate
	- Error rate of an [[Optimal]] [[classifier(s)]] (there will always be some irreducible error)
		- #compsci361example human performance
	- Can be hard to estimate
2. Avoidable bias
	- If we keep the training long enough, [[training error]] would always decrease
	- $Training\ Error - Optimal\ Error\ Rate$
1. [[variance]]
	- $Dev\ Error - Training\ Error$
	- smaller [[bias]] can lead to higher [[variance]] ([[Bias vs Variance tradeoff]])
