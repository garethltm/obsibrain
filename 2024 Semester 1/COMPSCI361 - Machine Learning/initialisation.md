Initialise the weights and [[bias]]es in the network
- Random: #compsci361example weights are initialized randomly from Uniform [-0.1,0.1]. [[bias]]es are initialized to 0s
- Zero: all weights are initialized to 0
Choices are based on personal experience

## With deep networks
always initialise weight randomly ( #compsci361example standard normal distribution) to break symmetry
## Additional tip
Also good to normalize inputs to mean zero and use random weight initialization with average weight centered at
