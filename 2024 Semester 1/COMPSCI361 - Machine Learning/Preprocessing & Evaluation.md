## When do you do the [[Data Preprocessing]]?
Before or After splitting the [[training data]] & [[test data]]?
- It should perform well on unseen data as well

[[Golden Rule of Machine Learning]]
- Don't see [[Data Preprocessing]] as a separate part of your model building (learning) task, see it as an integral part of the whole training process
