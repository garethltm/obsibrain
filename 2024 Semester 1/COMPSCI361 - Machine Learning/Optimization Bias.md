- Another name for [[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Overfitting|Overfitting]]
	- How biased is an error that we optimized over many possibilities?
- [[Optimization Bias]] of [[parameters]] learning
	- During learning, we could search over tons of different [[Decision Tree(s)]]
	- So we can get lucky & find 1 with low [[training error]]
