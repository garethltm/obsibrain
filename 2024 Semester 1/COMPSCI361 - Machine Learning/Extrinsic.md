[[Supervised Learning]] (the ground truth is available)
- Compare a [[Clustering]] against the ground truth using a certain [[Clustering]] quality measure
## Types of [[Extrinsic]] methods

- Normalized [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week10/Mutual Information]]
## Methods
A good [[Clustering]] quality measure $Q(C,G)$ for a clustering $C$ given the ground truth $G$, should satisfying following 4 essential criteria:
1. [[Cluster homogeneity]]
2. [[Cluster completeness]]
3. [[Rag bag]]
4. [[Small cluster preservation]]
