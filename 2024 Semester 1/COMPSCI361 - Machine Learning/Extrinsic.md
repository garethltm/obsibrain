[[Supervised Learning]] (the ground truth is available)
- Compare a [[Clustering]] against the ground truth using a certain [[Clustering]] quality measure
- #compsci361example Purity, Rand Index & Normalized Mutual Information
## Methods
A good [[Clustering]] quality measure $Q(C,G)$ for a clustering $C$ given the ground truth $G$, should satisfying following 4 essential criteria:
- Cluster homo
