- Training/test data is [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] if:
	- All examples come from the same distribution:
	- #compsci361example ![[Pasted image 20240312151153.png]]
	- taking one of the rows out does not affect the other in any way possible
- #compsci361example - Cards:
	- Pick a card, put it back in the deck, re-shuffle, repeat
		- [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]]
	- Pick a card, put it back in the deck, repeat
		- Depends
	- Pick a card, don't put it back, re-shuffle, repeat
		- probability is affected $\rightarrow$ not [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]]
