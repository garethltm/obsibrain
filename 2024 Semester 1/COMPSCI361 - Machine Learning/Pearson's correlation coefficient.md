$$
\rho_{A,B} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - \bar{A})(b_i - \bar{B})}{{n}\sigma_A\sigma_B} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_ib_i) - n\bar{A}\bar{B}}{{n}\sigma_A\sigma_B}
$$
with means $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$, number of instances $n$, and standard deviations $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$ 
- if $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$ is zero than the coefficient is undefined (they are not correlated when 0, only when we take )
