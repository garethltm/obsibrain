Consider an experiment in which we flip 10 coins, and we want to know the number of coins that come up heads. 

Here, the elements of the sample space $\Omega$ are 10-length sequences of heads and tails. For example, we might have $\omega = (H, H, T, H, T, H, H, T, T, T) \in \Omega$. 

However, in practice, we usually do not care about the [[probability]] of obtaining any particular sequence of heads and tails. Instead, we usually care about real-valued functions of outcomes such as the number of heads that appear among our 10 tosses or the length of the longest run of tails. These functions, under some technical conditions, are known as [[random variables]].
- numerical quantity that we need because of how many $H$ or $T$ is going to show
