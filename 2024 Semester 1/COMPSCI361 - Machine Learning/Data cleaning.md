Doesn't change dimensionality $\rightarrow$ keeping your size

1. [[Incomplete (Missing) Data]]
2. [[Noisy data]]
3. Outliers (finding outliers in the data)

Basic assumption in [[Golden Rule of Machine Learning]]: [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]]. But in real-world, data is dirty which leads to problems if data are:
1. **Incomplete** - lacking attribute values, certain attributes (company may have separate datasets for certain departments) or containing only aggregate data
2. **Noisy** - containing noise, errors or outliers (random stuff - external influence affecting data)
3. **Inconsistent** - containing discrepancies in codes or name (naming conventions, code bugs)
4. **Intentionally wrong** - data that is formatted correctly but not the true value (birthday thing)
