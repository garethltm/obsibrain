Doesn't change dimensionality $\rightarrow$ keeping your size

1. Missing values
2. Noisy data
3. Outliers (finding outliers in the data)

Basic assumption in machine learning: [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]]. But in real-world, data is dirty which leads to problems if data are:
1. **Incomplete** - lacking attribute values, certain attributes (company may have separate datasets for certain departments) or containing only aggregate data
2. **Noisy** - containing noise, errors or outliers (random stuff - external influence affecting data)
3. **Inconsistent** - containing discrepancies in codes or name (naming )
4. **Intentionally wrong**
