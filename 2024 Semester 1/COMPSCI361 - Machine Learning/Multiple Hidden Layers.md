Activations at hidden layers can be viewed as features extracted as functions of inputs
- features in the hidden layers are different from the input features (attributes)

Every hidden layer represents a level of abstraction (abstraction of the input)
- Complex features are compositions of simpler features (The more the input is propagated from the form of the shallow layer to the deep layer the more abstraction we have in the deep [[Neural Network (NN)]])

Number of layers is the depth of [[Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)]] $\rightarrow$
