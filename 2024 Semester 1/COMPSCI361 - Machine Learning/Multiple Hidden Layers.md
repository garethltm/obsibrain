Activations at hidden layers can be viewed as features extracted as functions of inputs
- features in the hidden layers are different from the input features (attributes)

Every hidden layer represents a level of abstraction (abstraction of the input)
- Complex features are compositions of simpler features (The more the input is propagated from the form )
