[[Quadratic Programming (QP)]] has well-studied solution (defined solution)

Lagrange Multipliers & Constrained Optimization (used to solve [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]])
- Finding the local minima & maxima of a differentiable function subject to equality or inequality constraints
- The point at which the function & constraint touch each other is the solution to the constrained optimization problem
