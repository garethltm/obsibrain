when you want to reduce the number of rows/columns in your dataset

- obtain 

1. Dimensionality reduction (number of features being reduced)
2. Numerosity reduction (number of examples/instances/entries)
3. Data compression (combination of both Dimensionality & Numerosity)

***Every model is a compression of your algorithm in some way***
