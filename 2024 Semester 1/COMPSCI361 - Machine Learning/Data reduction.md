when you want to reduce the number of rows/columns in your dataset

- obtain a reduced representation of the data set that is much smaller in volume but yet produces the same (or almost the same) analytical results
## Why is it used
- because a database may store terabytes of data, complex data analysis may take a long time to run the complete dataset
	- we want to make it more efficient by removing irrelevant/unwanted features that are [[Noise]]

1. Dimensionality reduction (number of features being reduced)
2. Numerosity reduction (number of examples/instances/entries)
3. Data compression (combination of both Dimensionality & Numerosity)

***Every model is a compression of your algorithm in some way***
