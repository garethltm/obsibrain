- Why does the [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] assumption make learning possible
	- Patterns in training examples are likely to be the same in test examples
- The [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] assumption is rarely true:
	- But is often a good approximation
	- There are other possible assumptions
- Also, we're assuming [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] across examples but not across features
- [[Learning Theory]] explores how [[Training error]] is related to test error
- We'll look at a simple example, using this notation:
	- $E_{train}$ is the error on training data
	- $E_{test}$
