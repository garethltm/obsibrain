	- Patterns in training examples are likely to be the same in test examples
- The [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] assumption is rarely true:
	- But is often a good approximation
	- There are other possible assumptions
- Also, we're assuming [[Independent & Identically Distributed (IID)]] across examples but not across features
