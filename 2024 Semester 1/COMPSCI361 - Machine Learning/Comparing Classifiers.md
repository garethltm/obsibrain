- Use 10-fold [[Cross-Validation (CV)]] to obtain error (accuracy, AUROC)
- These mean error rates are just estimates of error on the true population of future data cases
- What if the difference between the 2 error rates is just attributed to chance? (can be just at random that one is better than the other)
	- We use a test of statistical significance (We do a test where one is significantly better than the other)
		- If it is not significantly better
