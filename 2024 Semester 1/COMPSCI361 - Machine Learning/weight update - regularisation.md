Weight update:$$w \leftarrow w - \frac {dL}{dw}$$
- which is used to calculate a [[Loss Function]] with respect to $w$![[Pasted image 20240607003245.png]]

1. L2 penalises more large weights and less small weights than L1 $\rightarrow$ balance weight $w$
2. L1 shrinks weights to 0 while L2 shrinks weights evenly (L1 prefers if weight is 0)
