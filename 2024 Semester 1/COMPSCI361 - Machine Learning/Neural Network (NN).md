is the ultimate approximator, it can approximate & recover conventional [[Machine Learning (ML)]] methods such as [[Logistic Regression]], [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]], [[k-nearest neighbor (kNN)]] & [[Decision Tree(s)]]
## Capability of [[Neural Network (NN)]]
If you don't have the hidden layers $\rightarrow$ you cannot approximate the nonlinear functions
#### $M_1$
- 0 hidden layer + linear [[Activation Function]] $\rightarrow$ linear surface
#### $M_2$
- 0 hidden layer + non-linear [[Activation Function]] $\rightarrow$ linear surface ([[Logistic Regression]])
#### $M_3$
- 1 hidden layer + linear [[Activation Function]] $\rightarrow$ combination of linear surface
#### $M_4$
- 1 hidden layer +
