is the ultimate approximator, it can approximate & recover conventional [[Machine Learning (ML)]] methods such as [[Logistic Regression]], [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]], [[k-nearest neighbor (kNN)]] & [[Decision Tree(s)]]
## Capability of [[Neural Network (NN)]]
If you don't have the hidden layers $\rightarrow$ you cannot approximate the nonlinear functions
#### $M_1$ - 0 hidden layer
