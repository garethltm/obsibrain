an efficient way to perform [[Outlier Detection]] on moderately high dimensional datasets is to use the [[Local Outlier Factor (LOF)]] algorithm

[[Local Outlier Factor (LOF)]] computes a score (local outlier factor) reflecting the degree of abnormality of the observations. It measures the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.
