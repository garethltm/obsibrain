- harmonic mean of [[Precision (Exactness)]] & [[Recall (Completeness)]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240322004037.png]]

In general, it is the weighted measure of [[Precision (Exactness)]] & [[Recall (Completeness)]]
- $\beta$ is a weight 
	- assign $\beta$ times as much weight to [[Recall (Completeness)]] as to [[Precision (Exactness)]]

Most commonly used: $f\tiny{1}$
