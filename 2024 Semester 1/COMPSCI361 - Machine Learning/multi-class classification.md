is a type of [[Supervised Learning]] algorithm where the output is a discrete value representing one of three or more classes. Unlike [[binary classification]], which involves only two classes, [[multi-class classification]] involves predicting one class from multiple possibilities.

For example, a [[multi-class classification]] model could be trained to predict the type of fruit in an image (e.g., apple, banana, cherry, etc.), or to recognize the digit in an image of a handwritten number (0 through 9).

The model is trained using a set of input-output pairs, also known as training examples. Each training example consists of an input vector (or features) and a desired output value (or label). The model learns a function that maps the input to the output for these training examples. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

Common algorithms used for multi-class classification include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, and others. Some algorithms, like support vector machines, are inherently binary classifiers, but can be adapted for multi-class classification using strategies like one-vs-all or one-vs-one.
