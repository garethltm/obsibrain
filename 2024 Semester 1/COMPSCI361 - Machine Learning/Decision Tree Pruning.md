- There are different stopping criteria that are used in practice
	- You can not always achieve a clean split in the leaves
	- You can use threshold for [[Information gain]] to decide to stop
- However, sometimes the [[Information gain]] is low for several levels & then becomes high again (splits become more meaningful)
	- You typically grow the tree "too large" & then "prune" it back
- [[Reduced error pruning]]
