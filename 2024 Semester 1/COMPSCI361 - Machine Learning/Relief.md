- Instance-based heuristic for [[Attribute (Feature) selection]] 
- Intuitive algorithm

Uses random subset of the data instances to iteratively calculate weight values for each attribute, based on how important the attribute seems to be in discriminating between nearest neighbours in different classes.
- Larger the weight = more important is the attribute
