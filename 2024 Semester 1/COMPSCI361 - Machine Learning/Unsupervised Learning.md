- In [[Supervised Learning]]:
	- We have features $x_i$ & class labels $y_i$
	- Write a program that produces $y_i$ from $x_i$
- In [[Unsupervised Learning]]:
	- We only have $x_i$ values, but no explicit target labels
	- You want to do "something" with them (potentially learning patterns)

#compsci345example - some [[Unsupervised Learning]] tasks:
1. Outlier detection
	- Is this a 'normal' $x_i$?
2. Similarity search
	- Which examples look like this 
3. Association rules
4. Latent-factors
5. Data visualization
6. Ranking
7. Clustering
