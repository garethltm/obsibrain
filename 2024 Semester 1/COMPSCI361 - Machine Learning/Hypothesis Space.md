- Learning can be defined as searching the best hypothesis for all observed data
- For [[Decision Tree(s)|Decision Tree(s)]], the hypothesis space are all possible [[Decision Tree(s)|Decision Tree(s)]] that can be generated for a data set (specific)
- The learner searches through the space and returns the best hypothesis, for [[Decision Tree(s)|Decision Tree(s)]], the tree that potentially best predicts new data
- If the space is small enough, it is possible to test all hypotheses (then no [[Machine Learning (ML)]] needed)
	- possible to test all [[Decision Tree(s)|Decision Tree(s)]] that you can come up with
