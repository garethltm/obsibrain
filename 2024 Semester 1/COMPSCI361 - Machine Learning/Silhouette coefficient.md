- balance between 2 things
- A measure for distance within a [[cluster(s)]] and between [[cluster(s)]]
- Range [-1,1]. More positive, better [[cluster(s)]]$$
s(x) = \frac{b(x) - a(x)}{\max(a(x), b(x))}
$$
	- $a(x)$ is the mean distance between a point $x$ and all other points in the same [[cluster(s)]] 
		- (how compact is the [[cluster(s)]] $C_i$ to which $x$ belongs)
	- $b(x)$ is the mean distance between a point $x$ & all other points in the nearest [[cluster(s)]] 
		- (how separated is the [[cluster(s)]] $C_i$ to which $x$ belongs)
	- Fitness of [[cluster(s)]] $C_i$ in given [[Clustering]] can be measured by the average [[Silhouette coefficient]] value of all points in the [[cluster(s)]]
## Visualized [[Silhouette coefficient]]
- Typically we sort & plot $s(x)$ for each instance, grouped by [[cluster(s)]]![[Pasted image 20240604173656.png]]
- Almost all points have high $s(x)$, which means that they are much closer, on average, to the other members of their [[cluster(s)]] than to the members of the neighbouring [[cluster(s)]]

1. Left: 20 data points, generated by uniform random sampling
2. Middle: The [[dendrogram]] generated from [[Complete Linkage]]. The 3 [[cluster(s)]] suggested by the [[dendrogram]] are spurious (not representative) as they cannot be observed in the data.
3. Right: The rapidly decreasing $s(x)$ in each [[cluster(s)]] confirm the absence of a strong [[cluster(s)]] structure. Point 18 has a negative $s(x)$- on average closer to the green points (8,15,7,2,4,16) than to the other red points (1,3,13,14,6,9,19,11,20)
