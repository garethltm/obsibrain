- find [[principal subspace]] (denoted by the magenta line) such that the orthogonal projection of the data (red) points onto this subspace
## What happens?
- maximizes the variance of the projected (green) points
- minimizes the sum-of-squares of the projection errors, indicated by the blue lines
	- we want to find the best fitting line
## How it happens?

- We find the eigenvectors (principal components)
## Summary
- reducing a 2D space into 1
