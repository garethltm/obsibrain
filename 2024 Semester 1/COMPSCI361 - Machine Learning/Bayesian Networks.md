- Bayesian Belief networks allow [[conditionally independent]] 
## Motivation
- [[Naive Bayes]] assumption of [[conditionally independent]] is too restrictive
	- because they assume that a word appearing in 1 position of a text is completely unrelated to the word that appears in a different position
		- some structure is needed in order for a word to make sense in English
- but it's intractable without such assumptions
