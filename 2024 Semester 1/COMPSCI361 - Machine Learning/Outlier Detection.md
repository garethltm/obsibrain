## Why study the [[Outlier Detection]]?
- To ensure that the trained model generalizes well to valid range of test inputs, it's important to detect and remove [[Outlier]]
- In the [[Machine Learning (ML)]] pipeline, [[Data cleaning]] and [[Data Preprocessing]] is an important step as it helps you better understand the data. During this step, you deal with [[Incomplete (Missing) Data]], detect [[Outlier]] and more.
## Statistical methods for [[Outlier Detection]]
1. [[Z-score outlier detection]]
2. [[Interquartile Range Outlier Detection (IQR)]]
