- where every node in the graph will be 1 variable (no more target/input variables)
- a simple, graphical notation for [[conditionally independent]] assertions and hence for compact specification of full joint distributions
## Syntax
- a set of nodes, one per random variable $X_i$
- a set of directed edges between the nodes, each edge represents the direction of influence among random variables
- a directed, acyclic graph (no cycles) - No loops
- A [[conditional probability]] distribution for each node given its parent nodes:
	- $P(X_i|Parents(X_i))$
- Conditional distribution represented as a [[Conditional Probability Table (CPT)]] giving the distribution of $X_i$ for each combination of parent values
## Variable Relationships
- a graphical model of relationships
	- Encodes dependencies among the variables (can be causal dependencies)
		- $X$ is a parent of $Y$, if there is a directed edge from $X$ to $Y$
		- $X$ is an ancestor of $Y$ 
		- $Y$ is a descendant of $X$ 
			- if there is a directed path in the graph from $X$ to $Y$
			- #compsci361example ![[Pasted image 20240514235056.png]]
			- $X_1, X_2$ are parents of $X_3$
			- $X_2$ is the parent of $X_4$
			- $X_2$ has no ancestors/parents, but $X_2$ is ancestor of $X_3,X_4$ and $X_5$
