penalises large weight values
- keeping weights close to zero for some neurons (simplify the structure of the [[Neural Network (NN)]])

## Why use it?
- Penalises/constraints the weight values towards 0
	- a "weight shrinkage" or a "penalty against complexity"
	- E
#### Purpose of Regularisation
- Large weights:
	- are characteristic of more complex models (higher learning time)
	- can be a sign of an over-specialized network ([[overfit(ting)]])
	- make the network unstable (sensitive to [[Noise]])
