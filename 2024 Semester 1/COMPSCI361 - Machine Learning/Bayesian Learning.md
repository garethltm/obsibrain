- ***Learning is just another application of [[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Bayes Theorem|Bayes Theorem]]***
## Why is it so important?
1. Explicit manipulation of probabilities - (it defines a class/paradigm for creating new algorithms)
2. Useful framework for understanding learning methods that do not explicitly manipulate probabilities - (it creates a framework to reason with all the other algorithms out there)
	- Determine conditions under which algorithms output the most probable hypothesis
	- #compsci361example justification of [[Least Squares]] error function, why smaller [[deci]]
