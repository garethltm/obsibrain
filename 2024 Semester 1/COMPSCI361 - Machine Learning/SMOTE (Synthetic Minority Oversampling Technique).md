- combines [[Randomly under-sampling the majority class]] & [[Randomly over-sampling the minority class]]
- creates new examples that don't exist in your data - expands the minority class
	- generally, creates new artificial instances
### Process
- Find pairs of instances, in the minority class that are closest to each other
	- nearest neighbours within the class
- Create a new instance between these instances, assign it to the minority class
