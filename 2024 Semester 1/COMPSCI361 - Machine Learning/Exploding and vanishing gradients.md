[[gradient]]s are calculated in the [[Backpropagation]] process to update the weights in the desired direction
## Vanishing gradients:
caused by multiplying values ([[2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/chain rule|chain rule]])
- where the values decreases through the multiplication of decimals
