1. measure of variance
	- how sensitive we are to training data
2. measure of bias
	- how low can we make the [[Training error]]
3. measure of noise
	- how low can any model make test error

- Assume $\tilde{y} \tiny{i} \normalsize = \tilde{y} \tiny{i} \normalsize + \in$ , where $\in$ has mean 0 & variance $\sigma ^2$
- Assumes we have a learner that can take n training examples & use these to make predictions $\hat{y} \tiny{i}$
