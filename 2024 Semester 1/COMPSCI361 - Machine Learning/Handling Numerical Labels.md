One way to handle numerical $\huge {y}\tiny {i}$: discretize
#compsci361example for 'age' could we use age $\leq$ 20, 20 $<$ age $\leq 30$, age $>$ 30
Now we can apply methods for [[classification]] to do [[Regression]]
But [[coarse discretization]] loses resolution
- #compsci361example a 1 year old may be identified as 20 as well as it is in the same [[classification]]
& [[fine discretization]] requires a lot of data

There exists [[Regression]] versions of [[classification]] methods:
1. [[Regression]] trees, [[Probabilistic Model]], non-[[parameters]] models
