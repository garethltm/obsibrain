[[Data Mining]] and [[Machine Learning (ML)]] are very similar:
- [[Data Mining]] often viewed as closer to [[2023 Semester 2/INFOSYS222 - Database Systems/Database|Database]]
- [[Machine Learning (ML)]] often viewed as closer to [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]
	- in terms of [[Arithmetic]]

Both are similar to statistics, but more emphasis on:
- Large data sets and computation
- Predictions (instead of descriptions)
- Flexible models (that work on many problems)
	- to help with decision making
