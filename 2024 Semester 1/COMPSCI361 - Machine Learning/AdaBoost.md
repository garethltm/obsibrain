- a classic [[Boosting]] algorithm for binary [[classification]]

[[AdaBoost]] assumes we have a base binary [[classifier(s)]] that:
- is simple enough that it does not overfit much (moving from underfit towards overfit)
- Can obtain > 50% weighted accuracy on any dataset (need at least 50% accuracy otherwise it's not really improving)
