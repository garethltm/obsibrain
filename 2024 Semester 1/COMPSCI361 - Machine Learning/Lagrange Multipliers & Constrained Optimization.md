- Optimization function: $f=x^2+y^2$

1. Subject to constraint: $g=2x+6y=c$ , with $c=5$

	- At the minimum of $f$ such that constraint: $\nabla f = a\nabla g$
		- $gradient\ of\ f = a (gradient\ of\ g)$
	- Finding the minimum is then equivalent to solving: $\nabla f - a \nabla g = 0$
2. Subject to constraint: $g=2x +6y-5= 0$
