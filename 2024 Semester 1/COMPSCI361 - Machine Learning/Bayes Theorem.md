- everything is uncertain $\rightarrow$ everything is True to a certain degree
	- finding more False statements to disprove a hypothesis
$$P(Y|X) = \frac {P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}$$
- Search the most likely hypothesis 
	- giving the most likely model/proposition
## Basic assumption
- Quantities of interest are governed by probability distributions
- Optimal decisions can be made by reasoning about these probabilities together with observed [[training data]]

[[Machine Learning (ML)]] is interested in the best hypothesis h from space H, given obeser
