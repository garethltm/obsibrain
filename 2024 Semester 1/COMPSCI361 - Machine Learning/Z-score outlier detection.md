- The Z-score method for [[Outlier Detection]] uses a dataset's standard deviation and its mean to identify data points that are significantly different from the majority of the other data points

The Z-score for a value of $x$ in the dataset with a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is given by:
$$z=\frac{(x-\mu )}{\sigma}$$
The Z-score is equal to zero when
