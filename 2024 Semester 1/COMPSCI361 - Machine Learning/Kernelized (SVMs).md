Given a set of [[training data]] $S = \{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}, y_i \in \{+1, -1\}$
## Goal
The [[Kernelized (SVMs)]] algorithm aims to find a non-linear [[classifier(s)]], which is a separating [[hyperplane]]/[[hyperplanes]] in a higher dimensional space
## Approach
1. Transform the original input data into a higher dimensional space
2. Search for a [[Linearly Separable Data]] [[hyperplane]] in the new space
## Steps
#### Step 1: Space Transformation
$\Phi(\cdot)$: Transform the original input data into a higher dimensional space

- We can use a [[Hard-margin (SVMs)]] to derive a [[]]
