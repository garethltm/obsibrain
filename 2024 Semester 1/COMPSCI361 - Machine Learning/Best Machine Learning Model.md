- [[Decision Tree(s)]] are not always most accurate on [[test error]]
- What is the [[Best Machine Learning Model]]?
- An alternative measure of performance is generalization error
	- Average error over all $\large x\tiny i$ vectors that are not seen in the training set
		- Errors we don't see in our evaluation
	- How well we expect to do for a completely unseen feature vector
- No free lunch theorem
	- There is no best model achieving the best generalization error for every problem
	- If model A generalizes better to new data than model B on one dataset, there is another dataset where model B works better

## General idea
- there is no [[Best Machine Learning Model]]
