Model is so large that we cannot monitor the [[training error]] - we won't know if it's [[overfit(ting)]]
## Intuition
[[training data]] not sufficient to generalise on dev data
## Simple fix
Add data to the training set
## Disadvantages
- More data might not be available
- Try [[data augmentation]] during training
