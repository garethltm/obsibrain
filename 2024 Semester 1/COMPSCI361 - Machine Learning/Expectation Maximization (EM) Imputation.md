to kickstart the algorithm
Step 1: Set missing variables to the mean
Step 2: Assume certain initial values for the model parameters

- Probabilistic approach for modelling with hidden variables or [[Incomplete (Missing) Data]] (models you have never observed $\rightarrow$ you try to estimate)
- We model variables according to some data distribution with mean & co-variance
- Use other (observed) variables to impute the missing values (Expectation)
- Update the model [[parameters]] using the imputed values (Maximi)
