Train/dev/test sets with deep networks![[Pasted image 20240606234602.png]]
- If small dataset (100, 1,000, 10,000 samples)
	- 60%/20%/20%
- If large dataset (> 1,000,000 samples)
	- 98%/1%/1%

Training set, dev set ([[Validation set(s)]]) & test set usually need to come from same distribution (but it is ok varies a bit when gathering a lot of )
