- Improves approximation error of [[classifier(s)]] with high $E\tiny {approx}$ - models that overfit

Input: the prediction of a set of models
#compsci361example 
- [[Decision Tree(s)]] make 1 prediction
- [[Na√Øve Bayes classification]] makes another prediction
- [[k-nearest neighbour (KNN)]] makes another prediction

![[Simple model averaging]]

[[Averaging]] / [[Stacking]] often performs better than individual models

## Why does [[Averaging]] work?
