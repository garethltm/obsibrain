## Linear [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]
1. [[Hard-margin (SVMs)]]
2. [[Soft-margin (SVMs)]]
The difference between a [[Hard-margin (SVMs)]] & a [[Soft-margin (SVMs)]] lies in the separability of the data.
1. If our data is [[Linearly Separable Data]], we go for a [[Hard-margin (SVMs)]]
2. Otherwise, we would have to be tolerant & let some of the data points to be misclassified. In this case, a [[Soft-margin (SVMs)]] is appropriate
## Non-Linear [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]
1. [[Kernelized (SVMs)]]
## Problem Definition
- [[Margin Maximization]]
## What if we have more than 2 classes?
- Original [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]] can only perform [[binary classification]] (2 classes)
- [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]] can be extended to [[multi-class]] problems (more than 2 classes)
