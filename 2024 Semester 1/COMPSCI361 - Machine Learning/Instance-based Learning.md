- Compare new data points to known data points
- Non-parametric approaches
- Memory-based approaches
- Prediction can be expensive

Construct hypotheses directly from the training instances themselves
The hypothesis complexity can grow with the data (more [[training data]] = more complex)
#compsci361example if we have $n$ training items, the computational complexity of classifying a single new instance is $O(n)$
