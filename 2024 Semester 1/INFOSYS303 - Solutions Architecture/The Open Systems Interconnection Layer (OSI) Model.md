A digital communications network is a highly complex structure

Its main mission is the accurate, reliable & efficient delivery of messages
- which translates into delivery of packets (grouping of bits) - because messages need to be fragmented when they are sent out by a network

To understand how a digital communications network operate, it is necessary to break it down into layers of functions & responsibilities $\rightarrow$ model is known as [[The Open Systems Interconnection Layer (OSI) Model]]

### The interaction between layers
