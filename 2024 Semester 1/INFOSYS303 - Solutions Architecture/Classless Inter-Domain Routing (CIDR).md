We use the [[Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)]] (& [[Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)]]) addresses to allocate them to devices in a network. Laptops, PCs, workstations, wireless devices, servers, router interfaces, all receive each one [[Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)]] address, which is used to recognise the origin or the destination of the packets that make up a message or a session.

We call [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)]] the technique that allows us to organise the allocation of IP addresses to the devices in a network.
