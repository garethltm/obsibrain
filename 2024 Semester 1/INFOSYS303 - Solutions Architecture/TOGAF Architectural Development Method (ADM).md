- [[The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)]] ADM process is specifically designed to accelerate workflow across 4 domains of [[Enterprise Architecture]]
	1. [[Business Architecture]] (High-level conception)
	2. [[Applications Architecture]]
	3. [[Data Architecture]]
	4. [[Technical (Technology) Architecture]]

The [[TOGAF Architectural Development Method (ADM)]] provides a tested & repeatable process for developing architectures
The [[TOGAF Architectural Development Method (ADM)]] includes establishing an architecture framework, developing architecture content, transitioning, & governing the realization of architectures.
All these activities are carried out within an iterative cycle of continuous architecture definition & realization that allows organization to transform their enterprises in a controlled manner in response to business goals & oppportunities.
