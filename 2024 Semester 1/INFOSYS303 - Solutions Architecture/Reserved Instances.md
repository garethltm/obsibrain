**Reserved Instances** are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. There are two available types of Reserved Instances:

- Standard Reserved Instances
- Convertible Reserved Instances

You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option. 

**Standard Reserved Instances**: This option is a good fit if you know the EC2 instance type and size you need for your steady-state applications and in which AWS Region you plan to run them. Reserved Instances require you to state the following qualifications:

- **Instance type and size:** For example, m5.xlarge
- **Platform description (operating system):** For example, Microsoft Windows Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- **Tenancy:** Default tenancy or dedicated tenancy

You have the option to specify an Availability Zone for your EC2 Reserved Instances. If you make this specification, you get EC2 capacity reservation. This ensures that your desired amount of EC2 instances will be available when you need them. 

**Convertible Reserved Instances**: If you need to run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types, then Convertible Reserved Instances might be right for you. Note: You trade in a deeper discount when you require flexibility to run your EC2 instances.

At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. However, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:

- Terminate the instance.
- Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance family and size, Region, platform, and tenancy).
