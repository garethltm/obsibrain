Most cloud providers offer IP addresses with the purchase & deployment of cloud servers or storage. How many IP addresses are needed for your cloud environment? (how many public IP addresses & how many private IPs?)
## Public vs. Private IP addresses
- [[Network Address Translation (NAT)]]
- [[Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)]]
- Private IP addresses are used between cloud servers & other cloud services/infrastructure within a [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]]
- Private IP can be used to connect cloud endpoints within [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]] [[subnet(s)]].
## [[Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)]] & [[Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)]] Addresses
