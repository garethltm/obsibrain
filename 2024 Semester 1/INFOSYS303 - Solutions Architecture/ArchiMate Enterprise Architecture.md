- An [[Enterprise Architecture]] is a response to concerns by "stakeholders" that need to be addressed by the business & IT systems within an organization
- The role of the architect is to address these concerns by:
	- identifying & refining the motivation & strategy expressed by stakeholders
	- developing an architecture
	- creating views of the architecture that show how it **addresses & balances stakeholders concerns**
		- proving a case to the stakeholders

The [[ArchiMate Enterprise Architecture]] modeling language provides a uniform representation for diagrams that describe [[Enterprise Architecture]]

It includes concepts for specifying
- inter-related architectures
- specific viewpoints for selected stakeholders
- language customization mechanisms
(expressing our ideas in a graphical form that is easy to understand)

The language uses service-orientation to distinguish & relate the Business Application & Technology Layers of [[Enterprise Architecture]] & uses realization relationships to create concrete elements to more abstract elements across these layers

### Top-level hierarchical structure of the language
- A model is a collection of concepts
	- a concept is either an element or a relationship
- An element is either:
	- a behavior element
	- a structure element
	- a motivation element
	- a composite element
