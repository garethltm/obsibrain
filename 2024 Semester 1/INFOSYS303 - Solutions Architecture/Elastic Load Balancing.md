**Elastic Load Balancing** is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as [[Amazon EC2 instance(s)]]. 

A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. This means that as you add or remove [[Amazon EC2 instance(s)]] in response to the amount of incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first. Then, the requests spread across multiple resources that will handle them. For example, if you have multiple [[Amazon EC2 instance(s)]], Elastic Load Balancing distributes the workload across the multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it. 

Although [[Elastic Load Balancing]] and [[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling]] are separate services, they work together to help ensure that applications running in [[Amazon EC2]] can provide high performance and availability.
