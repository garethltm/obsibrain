- a CPUâ€™s processor.
- a processing unit of the CPU. 
- It is responsible for executing programs and multiple other actions on a computer.

In the old days, every processor had just one core that could focus on one task at a time. Today, CPUs have between two and 18 cores, each of which can work on different tasks.

A core can work on one task, while another core works on a different task, so the more processors a CPU has, the more efficient it is.
- splitting tasks into different cores

Many processors, especially those in laptops, have two cores.

Some laptop CPUs (known as mobile CPUs) have four.

Most processors can use a process called simultaneous multithreading to split into virtual cores, which are called threads.
- virtual cores = essentially allows VMs that can allow 2 Operating Systems (Ubuntu & Windows)
## 3 main parts
1. [[Control Unit (CU)]]
2. [[Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)]]
3. [[Memory]]
Other relevant particular elements of a [[CPU core]] are the [[clock]] & the [[buses]]
