Software on commodity hardware that coexists with or replaces traditional, proprietary network hardware, like switches & routers

A term coined when it became necessary to distinguish between hardware-based networking. [[Software Defined Networks (SDN)]] as the current & future state of networking

[[Software Defined Networks (SDN)]] is a [[Network Architecture Components]] approach that enables the network to be intelligently & centrally controlled using software applications.
- this helps operators manage the entire network consistently & holistically, regardless of underlying network technology.
## Competing forces influencing [[Software Defined Networks (SDN)]] adoption:
- Huge growth in multimedia content
- Rise in [[Cloud Computing]]
- Impact of increasing mobile usage
- Continuing business pressures to reduce costs
## Architecture
- facilitates a more agile & flexible networking solution
- allows enterprises & service providers to respond quickly to changing business requirements
(a network engineer can shape traffic from a centralised control console without having to touch individual switches in the network)
