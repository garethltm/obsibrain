EA tools help envision, model and plan for the future of the enterprise, offering features to
continuously evolve business and operating models. [[Enterprise architecture]] leaders should
select EA tools that support long-term transformation, modernization and innovation goals

## Market Definition/Description
Gartner defines the market for Enterprise Architecture Tools as tools that allow organizations to
examine both the need for, and the impact of, change. 

They allow users to capture the interrelationships and interdependencies within and between an ecosystem of partners, operating models, capabilities, people, processes, information, and applications and technologies. 

They provide a central repository to capture data and metadata about the [[artifact(s)]] that an enterprise
cares about, and their related life cycles. 

Models represent the relationships between these [[artifact(s)]] and are themselves treated as assets that help describe and shape the future of the enterprise.

EA tools provide a means to model the business and IT aspects of the enterprise in support of
business outcome delivery. Doing so requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders across the
organization â€” each playing a different role at a different time. 

The models and methods used by the stakeholders will vary depending on their role and must be integrated and connected to other models to be useful. To support these needs, EA tools have two aspects: 
1. The first provides a modeling environment, along with a supporting repository. 
2. The second facilitates collaboration between a diverse group of stakeholders across the organization, right from business strategy to IT.

A broad array of architectural and IT disciplines, such as business, information, solution, security, applications and infrastructure use EA tools. 
EA tools operate at many levels and across a wide spectrum to enable insights and support informed decision making. With such a broad array of stakeholders, EA tools must also facilitate their consumption of, and contribution to, the information contained within the repository. As they undertake their work, these users switch between an ever-
expanding set of views and visual representations of the datasets contained in the repository.
