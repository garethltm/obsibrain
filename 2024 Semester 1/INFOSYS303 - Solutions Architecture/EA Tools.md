EA tools help envision, model and plan for the future of the enterprise, offering features to
continuously evolve business and operating models. [[Enterprise architecture]] leaders should
select EA tools that support long-term transformation, modernization and innovation goals

## Market Definition/Description
Gartner defines the market for Enterprise Architecture Tools as tools that allow organizations to
examine both the need for, and the impact of, change. 

They allow users to capture the interrelationships and interdependencies within and between an ecosystem of partners, operating models, capabilities, people, processes, information, and applications and technologies. 

They provide a central repository to capture data and metadata about the [[artifact(s)]] that an enterprise
cares about, and their related life cycles. 

Models represent the relationships between these [[artifact(s)]] and are themselves treated as assets that help describe and shape the future of the enterprise.

EA tools provide a means to model the business and IT aspects of the enterprise in support of
business outcome delivery. Doing so requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders across the
organization — each playing a different role at a different time. 

The models and methods used by the stakeholders will vary depending on their role and must be integrated and connected to other models to be useful. To support these needs, EA tools have two aspects: 
1. The first provides a modeling environment, along with a supporting repository. 
2. The second facilitates collaboration between a diverse group of stakeholders across the organization, right from business strategy to IT.

A broad array of architectural and IT disciplines, such as business, information, solution, security, applications and infrastructure use EA tools. 

EA tools operate at many levels and across a wide spectrum to enable insights and support informed decision making. With such a broad array of stakeholders, EA tools must also facilitate their consumption of, and contribution to, the information contained within the repository. As they undertake their work, these users switch between an ever-expanding set of views and visual representations of the datasets contained in the repository.

The standard capabilities for this market include:
1. Repository: Provides a single source of truth for the organization with storage, categorization and versioning of objects, models and artifacts of various sorts, as well as the relationships between them, and related business artifacts and views.
2. Modeling: Structures relationships across entities, such as business strategies, objectives, goals, constraints, capabilities, personas, customer journeys, activities, processes, value streams, policies, decision models, metrics, applications, technologies, roadmaps, projects and programs.
3. Presentation: Displays and illustrations of information in the form of dashboards, heat maps, models and scenarios that contribute to the presentation capability of the tool. A variety of visual presentations helps colleagues understand and assess the impacts associated with decisions and proposed solutions.
4. Analysis: Identify, assess, prioritize and track gaps, challenges, opportunities and risks within and across portfolios of business capabilities, investments, processes, projects, applications and technologies.
5. Configuration and management: Setup and administration features to support the EA tool’s security, along with setting up different classes of users, their access rights and feature alignment including controlling access to information stored in the repository.
6. Publication: Enables wide consumption of the data contained within the EA tool across the enterprise and beyond. Tools should also be able to capture comments and feedback on that content and/or score elements contained in repository views.
7. Integration: Expose and import data to and from other products, enabling the EA tool to be a hub uniting other common tools in the enterprise technology ecosystem. This includes categories such as product management, configuration management database (CMDB), PPM, business process management suite (BPMS) and process mining.
8. Extensibility: Extend the metamodel of the EA tool through the definition of new modeling concepts and relationship types — up to new graphical representations and enforcing domain-specific rules.
9. Innovation management: Mechanisms that support the creation and tracking of innovation and change initiatives. This includes support for ideation, trendspotting and
the engagement of colleagues, PPM links and benefits realization.
10. Intelligent automation: AI-assisted and automated features that help EA practitioners
industrialize their activities and outputs delivering value more quickly and reliably, while
keeping information up-to-date and fresh. These features should focus on process and
policy automation functionality used within the tool (rather than served up externally).
11. Frameworks: Starting point for structuring the repository and the relationships among
artifacts, focusing on support for different architectural methods and vertical industry
models. This includes support in choosing the EA frameworks to adopt and to identify
overlaps and gaps.
