- collection of [[Amazon EC2]] instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of [[autoscaling]] & management

1. [[Target group]]

[[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling]] enables you to automatically add or remove [[Amazon EC2 instance(s)]] in response to changing application demand. By automatically scaling your instances in and out as needed, you can maintain a greater sense of application availability.

Within [[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling]], you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.
- _Dynamic scaling_ responds to changing demand. 
- _Predictive scaling_ automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
