If you’ve tried to access a website that wouldn’t load and frequently timed out, the website might have received more requests than it was able to handle. This situation is similar to waiting in a long line at a coffee shop, when there is only one barista present to take orders from customers.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand. By automatically scaling your instances in and out as needed, you can maintain a greater sense of application availability.

Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.

- _Dynamic scaling_ responds to changing demand. 
- _Predictive scaling_ automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
