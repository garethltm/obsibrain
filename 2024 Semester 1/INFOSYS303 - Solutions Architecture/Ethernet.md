- is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in [[The Local Area Network (LAN)]]
- commercially introduced in 1980 & first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3
- has been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes & longer link distances but retains much backward compatibility
- it has evolved to be used Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) & Wide Area Networks (WAN)
Over time, [[Ethernet]] has largely replaced competing wired [[The Local Area Network (LAN)]] technologies such as Token Ring, FD
