- strategic [[framework]] that aligns an organization's:
	1. business strategy
	2. processes
	3. information
	4. technology
		to achieve its goal
- provides a holistic view of the organization $\rightarrow$ effective decision-making, optimization of resources & adaptation to changes in the business environment
- combination of multiple underlying disciplines such as:
	1. [[Business Architecture]]
	2. IT architecture
	3. [[Technical (Technology) architecture]]
	4. Security architecture

## Purpose
- [[Enterprise Architecture]] aims to establish a [[framework]] that outlines and organization's structure & operations
	- It is done often through the creation of a [[Business Capabilities]] map or blueprint
- [[Enterprise Architecture]] also seeks to foster team alignment & standardization by ***harmonizing environments*** across teams and organizations

## Benefits
1. An ability to:
	1. grasp
	2. store
	3. structure
	4. analyze varied sources of information
		to solve unplanned or foreseeable problems in enterprise landscapes
2. An awareness of industry-relevant technologies and the competence to demonstrate (how a proposed service would impact a company)
3. The influence to implement enterprise-wide [[AGILE]] methodologies to accelerate product deployments & connect siloed organizational groups
4. A clear survey of an enterprise to extend data-driven findings to business leaders in order to prioritize investments and transformational strategies
5. Standardized processes help enterprises not only change for the better but become better at change itself
6. If established correctly $\rightarrow$ can add value to organizations through:
	1. enhanced processes
	2. efficiency
	3. decision-making
	However, its adoption is limited due to challenges
7. More effective strategic decision-making by C-Level executives & business leaders:
	1. Quick response to change & support for enterprise agility aligned with organization strategy
	2. Organizational transformation
	- Adopting new trends in business & technology
	3. Organizational change to support Digital Transformation
	4. Organizational & operating mode changes to improve efficiency & effectiveness
8. More effective & efficient business operations:
	1. Lower business operation costs
	2. More [[AGILE]] organization
	3. Business capabilities shared across the organization
	4. Lower change management costs
	5. More flexible workforce
	6. Improved business productivity
	7. Improved organization integration in support of mergers & acquisitions
9. More effective & efficient Digital Transformation operations:
	1. Extending effective reach of the enterprise
		- #infosys303example 
		- through digital capability
	2. Bringing all components of the enterprise into a harmonized environment
	3. Lower development, deployment, operations, support & maintenance costs
	4. Improved interoperability
	5. Improved system management
	6. Improved ability to address critical enterprise-wide issues
		- #infosys303example 
		- security
	7. Easier upgrade & exchange of system components
10. Better return on existing investment, reduced risk for future investment:
	1. Reduced complexity in business & IT
	2. Maximized [[Return On Investment (ROI)]] in existing business & IT
	3. The flexibility to make, buy or outsource business & IT solutions
	4. Understanding how [[Return On Investment (ROI)]] changes over time
11. Faster, simpler & cheaper procurement:
	1. Buying decisions are simpler, because the information governing procurement is readily available in a coherent plan
	2. The procurement process is faster
		- maximizing procurement speed & flexibility without sacrificing architectural coherence
	3. The ability to procure [[Heterogeneous]], multi-vendor open systems
	4. The ability to secure more economic capabilities
## Challenges
- Ambiguous starting points, implementation & governance gaps & the need for ongoing innovation pose obstacles to successful [[Enterprise Architecture]] programs.

Most common challenges:
1. Lacking business buy-in
2. Absence of leadership & vision
3. No tool/the wrong tool for the job
4. Too much planning but too little doing
5. Trying to model everything
6. Solving problems on the wrong level
	- This becomes challenging

## Process
- breaking down the starting point into several steps can make the process more manageable:
	1. Define goal & objective
	2. Identify the key stakeholders
	3. Select a modern [[Enterprise Architecture]] tool
	4. Assess the current state of IT infrastructure & systems
	5. Develop a future state architecture
		- vision
	6. Create an implementation plan
	7. Monitor progress and adjust the [[Enterprise Architecture]] [[framework]]
