A [[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]] allows us to provision logically isolated section of the Cloud where we can launch resources in the virtual network of our choice.
## These resources can be:
1. public (facing) $\rightarrow$ so they have access to the Internet
2. private $\rightarrow$ for backend services like databases or application services
	- usually have no internet access
The public & private grouping of resources are known as [[subnet(s)]]
