To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can design your application through a **[[microservices]]** approach.

In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. 

When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions. Two services facilitate application integration: [[Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)]] and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
