 The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports nonrepudiation (basically showing who sent what as proof), deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection & prevention & after-action recovery & legal action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an achievable goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party. Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes
