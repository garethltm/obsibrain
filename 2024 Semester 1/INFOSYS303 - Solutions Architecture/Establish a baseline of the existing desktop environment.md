## 1st step
- gather baseline information on the key user groups that have been identified as good candidates for a [[Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)]] environment
- ##### Purpose
- to understand the performance characteristics of the target users' workload:
	- What applications do they need?
	- Are there applications more CPU or memory-intensive?
	- Are there an excessive number of storage operations? 
		- Key to inquire: paying attention to which storage is being accessed frequently
	- What type of network load is being generated by the end users' activities?
## How to measure
- a performance-monitoring tool will help us gather the necessary baseline information
### Tools that can assist us with this process
1. VMware Capacity Planner
2. Liquidware Labs Stratusphere FIT
3. Lakeside Software SysTrack
In addition, both Windows XP & Windows 7 ship with Performance Monitor (`Perfmon`), a performance logs & alerts tool. `Perfmon` allows administrators to capture & graph various performance statistics from both local & remote computers.
Physical-to-virtual hardware mapping is less important & should be considered separat
