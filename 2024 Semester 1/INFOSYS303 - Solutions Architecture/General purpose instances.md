**General purpose instances** provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
- application servers
- gaming servers
- backend servers for enterprise applications
- small and medium databases

Suppose that you have an application in which the resource needs for compute, memory, and networking are roughly equivalent. You might consider running it on a general purpose instance because the application does not require optimization in any single resource area.
