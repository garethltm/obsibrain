- provides serverless architecture technology to develop functions
- implement code in response to events without changing the greater code infrastructure

Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run & manage application functionalities without the complexity of building & maintaining the infrastructure.

Perfect for users who need cloud only for individual functions within their apps. Users won't need to create the infrastructure usually needed for app development

- AWS (Lambda)
- Google Cloud Function

## How does it work?
Using the [[Function as a Service (FaaS)]] delivery model, users aren't responsible for maintaining application servers. They're externally hosted by the cloud provider who manages the servers.

1. Users can run backend code while the provider secures & allocates the application resources needed for the process
2. Developers deploy pieces of code known as functions to be performed on-demand
3. According to this demand, the [[Function as a Service (FaaS)]] provider creates a server to execute the function
4. Once the function is complete, that server is shut down

This model is ideal for simple, repetitive functions like scheduling tools or processing requests.

## Benefits
1. A 'pay-as-you-go' model helps businesses to save up-front hardware & operating system costs
2. [[Function as a Service (FaaS)]] offers scaling opportunities, as cloud service providers give on-demand services. 
	- When you need the services, they're there. 
	- When you don't, they're gone.
3. On-demand access without unnecessary costs translates into [[2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/Scalability|Scalability]]
4. [[Function as a Service (FaaS)]] platforms are easy to use & simple to understand. We don't need to be cloud experts to get the results we want. We can simply upload the code with instrucutio
