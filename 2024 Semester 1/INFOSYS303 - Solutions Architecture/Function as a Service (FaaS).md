- provides serverless architecture technology to develop functions
- implement code in response to events without changing the greater code infrastructure

Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run & manage application functionalities without the complexity of building & maintaining the infrastructure.

Perfect for users who need cloud only for individual functions within their apps. Users won't need to create the infrastructure usually needed for app development

- AWS (Lambda)
- Google Cloud Function

## How does it work?
Using the [[Function as a Service (FaaS)]] delivery model, users aren't responsible for maintaining application servers. They're externally hosted by the cloud provider who manages the servers.

Users can run backend code while the provider secures & allocates the application resources needed for the process

Developers deploy pieces of code known as functions to be performed on-demand
