is a [[Cloud Computing]] feature that automatically adjusts the number of computational resources in response to changing workloads

It allows systems to efficiently handle fluctuations in demand by scaling resources up or down based on predefined parameters such as CPU utilization, network traffic or other metrics

This ensures optimal performance, cost-effectiveness & reliability without manual intervention, enabling organizations to adapt to varying workload demands in their cloud infrastructure seamlessly
## Importance of [[autoscaling]]
