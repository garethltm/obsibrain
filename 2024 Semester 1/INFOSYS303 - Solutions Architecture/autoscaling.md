is a [[Cloud Computing]] feature that automatically adjusts the number of computational resources in response to changing workloads

It allows systems to efficiently handle fluctuations in demand by scaling resources up or down based on predefined parameters such as CPU utilization, network traffic or other metrics

This ensures optimal performance, cost-effectiveness & reliability without manual intervention, enabling organizations to adapt to varying workload demands in their cloud infrastructure seamlessly
## Importance of [[autoscaling]]
1. Optimized Performance
	- [[autoscaling]] ensures that your system can handle varying levels of traffic or workload without sacrificing performance.
		- by automatically adjusting resources in response to demand, it maintains consistent performance levels even during peak usage periods.
2. Cost Efficiency
	- it helps in optimizing costs by automatically scaling resources up when demand increases & scaling down during periods of low demand.
		- this prevents over-provisioning of resources, thereby minimizing unnecessary expenses.
3. Improved Reliability
	- with [[autoscaling]], you can distribute workloads across multiple instances or servers, reducing the risk of system failures or downtime
		- this redundancy enhances the overall reliability & availability of your applications & services
4. Operational Efficiency
	- by automating the process of resource provisioning & management, [[autoscaling]] reduces the burden on operations teams, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.
		- this streamlines operations & improves overall efficiency within your organization.
5. Fault Tolerance
	- [[autoscaling]] enhances fault tolerance by distributing workloads across multiple instances or servers
		- if any individual instance fails, [[autoscaling]] can quickly replace it with a new instance, ensuring continuous operation & minimizing downtime.
