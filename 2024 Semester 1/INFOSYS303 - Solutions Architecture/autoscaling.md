is a [[Cloud Computing]] feature that automatically adjusts the number of computational resources in response to changing workloads

It allows systems to efficiently handle fluctuations in demand by scaling resources up or down based on predefined parameters such as CPU utilization, network traffic or other metrics

This ensures optimal performance, cost-effectiveness & reliability without manual intervention, enabling organizations to adapt to varying workload demands in their cloud infrastructure seamlessly
## Importance of [[autoscaling]]
1. Optimized Performance
	- [[autoscaling]] ensures that your system can handle varying levels of traffic or workload without sacrificing performance.
		- by automatically adjusting resources in response to demand, it maintains consistent performance levels even during peak usage periods.
2. Cost Efficiency
	- it helps in optimizing costs by automatically scaling resources up when demand increases & scaling down during periods of low demand.
		- this prevents over-provisioning of resources, thereby minimizing unnecessary expenses.
3. Improved Reliability
	- with [[autoscaling]], you can distribute workloads across multiple instances or servers, reducing the risk of system failures or downtime
		- this redundancy enhances the overall reliability & availability of your applications & services
4. Operational Efficiency
	- by automating the process of resource provisioning & management, [[autoscaling]] reduces the burden on operations teams, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.
		- this streamlines operations & improves overall efficiency within your organization.
5. Fault Tolerance
	- [[autoscaling]] enhances fault tolerance by distributing workloads across multiple instances or servers
		- if any individual instance fails, [[autoscaling]] can quickly replace it with a new instance, ensuring continuous operation & minimizing downtime.

## How does [[autoscaling]] work?
![[Pasted image 20240528213139.png]]
## Strategies
- Proactive Scaling $\rightarrow$ Anticipate load changes #infosys303example scheduled events
- Reactive Scaling $\rightarrow$ Respond to actual load #infosys303example based on metrics
- Manual Scaling $\rightarrow$ Trigger scaling manually #infosys303example during maintenance
## Challenges
1. Complexity of Configuration
	- Setting up [[autoscaling]] involves configuring groups, defining scaling policies, & establishing monitoring, which can be intricate & requires expertise
2. Cost Management
	- [[autoscaling]] can lead to unexpected costs if not configured properly, due to unpredictable traffic patterns or over-provisioning
3. Scaling Limitations
	- Certain applications, especially stateful ones or legacy systems, may not be suitable for dynamic scaling, presenting a challenge for [[autoscaling]] implementation
4. Performance Impact
	- Scaling events can affect application performance, necessitating strategies to minimize degradation during these events
5. Handling Stateful Components
	- Managing stateful components like databases in an [[autoscaling]] environment is challenging due to the need for data consistency & [[Availability]] during scaling events
6. Network Considerations
	- [[autoscaling]] can introduce network configuration & communication challenges, particularly in distributed systems or [[2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/microservices|microservices]] architectures
## Real World Use Cases
1. Web Applications #infosys303example UBER
	- [[autoscaling]] ensures that the application can handle peak loads during busy periods while minimizing costs during periods of low activity.
2. E-commerce sites #infosys303example Amazon
	 - often experience spikes in traffic during sales events, promotions or holiday seasons
	 - [[autoscaling]] facilitates dynamically scaling resources to accommodate increased demand, ensuring that customers can access the website without experiencing slowdowns or outages.
3. Media streaming platforms #infosys303example Netflix
	- Varying levels of demand depending on the popularity of content & time of day
	- [[autoscaling]] facilitates scaling their streaming infrastructure up or down in real-time to ensure smooth playback uninterrupted streaming for users
4. Online Gaming
	- Must scale their infrastructure to handle unpredictable spikes in player activity, especially during game launches, updates or special events.
	- [[autoscaling]] ensures that game servers can dynamically adjust their capacity to accommodate player demand & provide a seamless gaming experience.
