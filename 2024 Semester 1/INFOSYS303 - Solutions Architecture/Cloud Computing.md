Cloud is a model of computing where servers, networks, storage, development tools, and even applications (apps) are enabled through the internet. Instead of organizations having to make major investments to buy equipment, train staff & provide ongoing maintenance, some or all these needs are handled by a cloud service provider (CSPs).

## Key things
1. [[Internet Access]]
2. [[Measured Service]]
3. [[On-demand Self-Service]]
4. [[Shared Resource Pooling]]
5. [[Rapid Elasticity]]

## Types of [[Cloud Computing]]
1. Deployment models
	1. [[Public Cloud]]
	2. [[Private Cloud]]
	3. [[Hybrid Cloud]]
	4. [[Multi-cloud]]
2. Service categories
	1. [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]]
	2. [[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]]
	3. [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]]

- In the past, choosing a [[Hyperscaler(s)]] meant picking [[Public Cloud]] over [[Private Cloud]]. This is no longer the case. To support regulatory, performance & data gravity requirements, the [[Hyperscaler(s)]] are now offering [[Private Cloud]] carveouts in public environments.

1. VMware on AWS (VMC)
2. Azure VMware Services (AVS)
3. Google's SAP
4. Oracle
5. Bare Metal
Similarly, the [[Hyperscaler(s)]] have been working on [[Private Cloud]] extensions. This blurring of [[Public Cloud]] & [[Private Cloud]] under a [[Hybrid Cloud]] umbrella is likely to accelerate in the future. Over time, we will no longer see a delineation between "public" & "private" but between "dedicated" & "shared".
