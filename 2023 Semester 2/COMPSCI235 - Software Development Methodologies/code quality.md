1. [[Qualitative metrics]]
2. [[Quantitative metrics]]

### Improving [[code quality]] 
1. Keep it simple
2. Avoid shortcuts
3. Care about design of your code:
	1. Good names for variables, methods,...
	2. Short methods, smaller classes,... ([[Refactoring]])
	3. Learn by reading good code
4. Write tests with high coverage
	- test should cover new functionalities that are just newly added
5. Run all your test before check-in
6. Check-in frequently
	- [[Continuous Integration (CI)]]
7. Learn your language
	- If you're switching languages or using multiple languages; know the difference
8. Use a coding standard
	- good variable names
9. Analyze code - before code reviews
10. Schedule time to lower your [[technical debt]]
11. Constant [[code review]]
