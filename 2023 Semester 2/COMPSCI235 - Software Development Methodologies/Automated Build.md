The [[Software Build]] is automated when the tasks defined in the build:
- require no direct human intervention
- are repeatable
- can be performed at any time with no information other than what is stored in the source code control repository
>	#Example 
>	a remote VCS like [[GitHub]]
- to automate builds we use "[[build scripts]]"
