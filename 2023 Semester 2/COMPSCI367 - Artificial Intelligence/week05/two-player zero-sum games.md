[[game]]-playing as Search
- A [[game tree]] can be considered as a search space
- Search is carried out by 2 players, rather than 1
- 2 players have opposing [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]]:
	- MAX - wants to maximise payoff
	- MIN - wants to minimise payoff
- The players take turns to choose a [[successor(s)]]
For any player, the [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] is to identify an optimal strategy for the game that starts at the root of the [[game tree]]
- this search process is called [[Adversarial Search]]
