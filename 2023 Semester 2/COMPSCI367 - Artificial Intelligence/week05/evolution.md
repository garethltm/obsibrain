### The idea of [[evolution]]
- every individual of a given species is evaluated based on how fit([[fitness]]) they are to the [[Environment]]
#### Necessary conditions of [[evolution]]
- a [[population]] of individuals
	-  cannot just have 1 person
- Variety among individuals
	- they should be different - otherwise same child = no variety
- differences in ability to survive in the [[Environment]] that are associated with the variety
	- different levels of [[fitness]]
- individuals are able to [[reproduce]]
	- we don't want offspring to be randomly generated - you might loose some good traits
		- an offspring inherits features for the parents, with potential mutations
