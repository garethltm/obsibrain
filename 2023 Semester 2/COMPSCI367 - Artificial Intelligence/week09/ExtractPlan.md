If [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] can be achieved, extract [[action(s)]] variables at each time 1≤ i ≤ t to form a [[plan]]
- index time steps by $t=0,1,2,3,...$
- a [[proposition(s)]] needs to have a finite length (to specify a max time value)
- Remember to set a hyperparameter `(Tmax)` to bound the length of the plan
