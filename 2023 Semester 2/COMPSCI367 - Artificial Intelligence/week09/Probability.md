imagine a very large number n of possible [[worlds]] which an event has had an opportunity to occur:
- k → number of [[worlds]] in which the event has occurred
- n-k → number of [[worlds]] in which the event hasn’t occurred
- k/n → [[Probability]] of the event

1. 0 is event certain not to occur
2. 1 is event certain to occur
which leads to [[Probability Theory]]

- Given a [[Belief measure]] $\mu$ over $\ohm$, the [[Probability]] of a [[proposition(s)]] $\alpha$ is $P(\alpha )=\mu ({w \in \ohm :\ w\ \vDash \alpha})$ 
	- ${w \in \ohm :\ w\ \vDash \alpha}$ $\rightarrow$ [[Belief measure]] of all possible [[State(s)]] that [[entails]] that the [[proposition(s)]] is TRUE
