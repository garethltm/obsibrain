- every [[World Model]] of agent can be implemented based on some learning constraint
- learning is **NOT** a separate module, more of a set of technique for improving the existing modules

### Why learning is necessary?
- may be difficult/impossible for humans to design all aspects of the system by hand
- agent may need to adapt to new situations without being re-programmed
