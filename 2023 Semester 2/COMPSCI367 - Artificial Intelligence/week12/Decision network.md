a [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week09/Probability]] graph model that ==extends a [[Single-stage decision networks (SSDN)]]== to allow both [[Chance nodes]] & [[Decision nodes]] to be parents of [[Decision nodes]]
- graph is acyclic
	- no cycles/loops
- [[Decision nodes]]
- [[no forgetting property]]
- [[Conditional Probability Table (CPT)]] where $P(C\tiny i\normalsize | parents(C\tiny i\normalsize)$) is assigned to every [[Chance nodes]]
- [[Utility function]] u(parents(u)) is given

We will be assuming the [[no forgetting property]] for all [[Decision network]]
