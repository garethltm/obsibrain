- heuristic cost â‰¤ actual cost to goal
- never overestimates the cost to reach the goal & consistent
- often be derived from the exact solution cost of a simplified or "relaxed" version of the problem
	> with some of the constraints weakened/removed
	
A **heuristic** is admissible if it is always [[optimistic]].
