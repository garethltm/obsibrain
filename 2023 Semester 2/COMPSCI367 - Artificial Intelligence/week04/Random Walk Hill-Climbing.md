- assuming that adding randomisation may avoid the search from getting stuck in a local optimal.
	- Pick a parameter (walk [[Probability]]) $p âˆˆ [0,1]$
	- At every step:
		- With probability $p$, make an [[uninformed random walk]]
		- With probability $1-p$, make a [[greedy choice]]: choose the [[successor(s)]] that has the least loss
- If the set of [[State(s)]] S is finite & every state is reachable from every other state by the step function
	- Then [[Random Walk Hill-Climbing]] is [[Probabilistic Approximately Complete (PAC)]]
