- super imposed over the [[State Space]]
- Root: search node corresponding to the [[Initial State (Start State)]]
- Leaf nodes: correspond to [[State(s)]] that have no [[successor(s)]] in the [[Search Tree]] because they were not expanded or generated no new nodes
Every time we perform a search, we actually have to create a [[Search Tree]] which records all our transitions around that graph
