- Also called shrinkage, since it shifts the [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week09/Probability]] distribution towards a uniform distribution
	- assumes your sample is not the representative of the real world
- This amounts to saying that we think the training data contains limited information about the true distribution
	- trying to avoid [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week10/overfitting]]
