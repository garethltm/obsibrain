## Types of Data Models
- Conceptual - 1st Level (build this first/data perspective)
    - Business View: Relations, Elements, Domains

- Logical - 2nd Level (ERD)
    - Designer View: Entities, Attributes, Relationships

- Physical - 3rd Level (implement as a systemâ€™s view)
    - Systems View: Tables, Datatypes, Constraints

## Methods
#### Top-Down Modelling
- driven by business requirements
- purpose is to define database design
- outcome is a physical database

#### Bottom-Up Modelling
- relevant for reverse engineering
- starts with existing database (most likely incomplete)
- outcome is a database design artefact
