1. Functional
	- A is functionally dependent on [[Attribute(s)]] B if each value of B uniquely determines the value of A
	- Denoted as B → A
2. Transitive
	- When an [[Attribute(s)]] A depends on another [[Attribute(s)]] B, & B itself depends on a third [[Attribute(s)]] C. this creates an indirect [[Relationship]] between A & C (transiting through B)
	- Denoted as C → B → A
