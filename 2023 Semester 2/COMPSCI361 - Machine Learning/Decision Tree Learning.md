- [[Decision Stumps]] have only 1 rule based on 1 feature
	- Very limited class of models: usually not very accurate for most tasks
- [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]] allow sequences of splits based on multiple features
	- You can do combination of features & take all kinds of relationships into account
	- Very general class of models: can get very high accuracy
	- However, it's computationally infeasible to find the best [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]]
		- too many [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]] generated
- How would you build the tree?
	- Most common [[2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]] learning algorithm in practice:
		- [[Greedy recursive splitting]]
