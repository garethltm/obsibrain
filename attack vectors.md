is an entry point or route for an attacker to gain access to a system.![Diagram showing eight of the most common attack vectors: Email, Social Media, Removable Devices, Browsers, Cloud Services, Insiders, Devices, and Wireless.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-cybersecurity-threats-attacks-mitigations/media/attack-vectors.png)
Email is perhaps the most common attack vector. [[cybercriminal(s)]] will send seemingly legitimate emails that result in users taking action. This might include downloading a file, or selecting a link that will compromise their device. Another common attack vector is through wireless networks. Bad actors will often tap into unsecured wireless networks at airports or coffee shops, looking for vulnerabilities in the devices of users who access the wireless network. Monitoring social media accounts, or even accessing devices that are left unsecured, are other commonly used routes for cyberattacks. However, you should know that attackers donâ€™t need to rely on any of these. They can use a variety of less obvious attack vectors. Here are some examples:

- **Removable media**. An attacker can use media such as USB drives, smart cables, storage cards, and more to compromise a device. For example, attackers might load malicious code into USB devices that are subsequently provided to users as a free gift, or left in public spaces to be found. When they're plugged in, the damage is done.
- **Browser**. Attackers can use malicious websites or browser extensions to get users to download malicious software on their devices, or change a user's browser settings. The device can then become compromised, providing an entry point to the wider system or network.
- **Cloud services**. Organizations rely more and more on cloud services for day-to-day business and processes. Attackers can compromise poorly secured resources or services in the cloud. For example, an attacker could compromise an account in a cloud service, and gain control of any resources or services accessible to that account. They could also gain access to another account with even more permissions.
- **Insiders**. The employees of an organization can serve as an attack vector in a cyberattack, whether intentionally or not. An employee might become the victim of a cybercriminal who impersonates them as a person of authority to gain unauthorized access to a system. This is a form of social engineering attack. In this scenario, the employee serves as an unintentional attack vector. In some cases, however, an employee with authorized access may use it to intentionally steal or cause harm.
