paying the bank alot of interest at first then slowly decreasing over time.

Overall, a very good thing to take advantage of.

#acctg151gExample 
Growth of $1,000 at 10% pa interest
[[Future Value (FV)]] = [[Present Value (PV)]] $\times$ $(1 + r)^n$ ^b7774c
n = 40, r = 10%
Factor is 45.259,
$1,000 $\times$ 45.259 = $45,259 ^d3a7bd

- $(1 + r)$ = growth factor
- PV = money taken from your own pocket
