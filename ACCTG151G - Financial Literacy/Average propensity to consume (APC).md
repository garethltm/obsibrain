In economics, the [[Average propensity to consume (APC)]] is the fraction of income spent and is computed by diving consumption by income.
$$APC = \frac {C}{Y}$$
- C = the amount spent (consumed)
	- final purchase of goods
	- #acctg151gExample 
	- iphone, car, tv,...
- Y = (gross income) **BEFORE TAX INCOME**

#### Disposable income
$$ APC = \frac {C}{Y-T}$$
- T = taxes
this one is more viable as you can't control the amount of tax you would receive
