- without compounding
	- we don't consider interest

#acctg151gExample 
$1000 = principle (your own money)
10% is the fixed proportion of the principle
- your principle would be fixed = fixed interest

$1000 @ 10% pa for 40 years
= Principle + (Interest $\times$ Periods)
= $1000 + (100 $\times$ 40)
= $1000 + $4000
= $5000
