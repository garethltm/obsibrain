Microsoft Entra External ID enables secure access for external identities to your apps and resources. This solution supports various external users, including partners, consumers, and business customers, allowing them to use their own identities. These identities can be from corporate or government-issued accounts, or social identity providers like Google or Facebook.![Diagram showing elements of Microsoft External ID.

Microsoft Entra External ID helps manage external users by addressing different scenarios:
- **Collaborate with business guests**.
- **Secure apps for consumers and business customers**.

Organizations can configure their Microsoft Entra ID tenant in two ways:
1. **Workforce Tenant Configuration**: For employees, internal business apps, and organizational resources. External business partners and guests can also be invited.
2. **External Tenant Configuration**: Exclusively for External ID scenarios, such as publishing apps to consumers or business customers.
![Diagram showing a representation of the two external ID scenarios and the corresponding tenant type. Collaboration with business guests uses a workforce tenant configuration. External facing apps use an external tenant configuration.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/external-id-tenant-configurations.png)
