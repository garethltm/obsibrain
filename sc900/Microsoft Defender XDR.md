is an enterprise defense suite of solutions that protects against sophisticated cyberattacks. [[Microsoft Defender XDR ]]allows admins to assess threat signals from endpoints, applications, email, and identities to determine an attack's scope and impact. It gives greater insight into how the threat occurred, and what systems have been affected. [[Microsoft Defender XDR]] can then take automated action to prevent or stop the attack.

The [[Microsoft Defender XDR]] suite includes:
- **[[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint]]**
- **[[Defender Vulnerability Management]]**
- **[[Microsoft Defender for Office 365]]**
- **[[Microsoft Defender for Identity]]** 
- **[[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps]]** - 

[[Microsoft Defender XDR]] now also **integrates with [[Microsoft Security Copilot]]**. Integration with Security Copilot can be experienced through the standalone and embedded experiences.

The information and insights surfaced by the Microsoft Defender XDR suite of solutions are centralized in the **Microsoft Defender portal**, which delivers a unified security operations platform. As a unified security operations platform, the Microsoft Defender portal now includes information and insights from other Microsoft security products, including Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Users also access the **Microsoft Threat Intelligence** solution from the Microsoft Defender XDR portal. Microsoft Defender TI aggregates and enriches critical threat information to help security analyst triage, incident response, threat hunting, and vulnerability management workflows.

Throughout the rest of this module, you'll learn more about the solutions that are part of Microsoft Defender XDR, the Microsoft Defender portal, the integration of Microsoft Defender XDR with Microsoft Security Copilot, and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence.
