is designed to help protect your applications & servers by analyzing network traffic & discarding anything that looks like a [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attack.![Diagram showing network flow into Azure from both customers and attackers, and how  Azure DDoS Protection filters out DDoS attacks.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/media/2-network-flow.png)
- [[Azure DDoS Protection]] service protects at layer 3 ([[Network layer]]) & layer 4 (transport layer)
### Benefits
1. **Always-on traffic monitoring**: Your application traffic patterns are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, looking for indicators of DDoS attacks. [[Azure DDoS Protection]] instantly and automatically mitigates the attack, once it's detected. As part of the mitigation, traffic sent to the protected resource is redirected by the [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] protection service and several checks are performed. [[Azure DDoS Protection]] drops attack traffic and forwards the remaining traffic to its intended destination. Within a few minutes of attack detection, you're notified using Azure Monitor metrics.
2. **Adaptive real time tuning**: Intelligent traffic profiling learns your application's traffic over time, and selects and updates the profile that is the most suitable for your service. The profile adjusts as traffic changes over time.
3. **DDoS Protection telemetry, monitoring, and alerting**: [[Azure DDoS Protection]] exposes rich telemetry via Azure Monitor. You can configure alerts for any of the Azure Monitor metrics that DDoS Protection uses. You can integrate logging with Azure Event Hubs, Azure Monitor logs, and Azure Storage for advanced analysis via the Azure Monitor Diagnostics interface.
### Tiers
1. **DDoS Network Protection**: The DDoS Network Protection service (available as a SKU), combined with application design best practices, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks. It's automatically tuned to help protect your specific Azure resources in a virtual network. Protection is simple to enable on any new or existing virtual network, and it requires no application or resource changes.
2. **DDoS IP Protection**: DDoS IP Protection is a pay-per-protected IP model. DDoS IP Protection contains the same core engineering features as DDoS Network Protection, but differs in that it doesn't include the value-added services such as [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] that are part of [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] Network Protection.
### Why consider adding [[Azure DDoS Protection]] services if services running on Azure?
- Azure is inherently protected by the default infrastructure-level [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] protection
- The reason is because the protection that safeguards the infrastructure has a higher threshold than most applications have the capacity to handle, & doesn't provide telemetry or alerting. So while traffic volume may be perceived as harmless by the platform, it can be devastating to the application gets dedicated monitoring to detect attacks & application specific thresholds. A service will be protected with a profile that is tuned to its expected traffic volume, providing a tighter defense against [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks.
