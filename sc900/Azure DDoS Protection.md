is designed to help protect your applications & servers by analyzing network traffic & discarding anything that looks like a [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attack.![Diagram showing network flow into Azure from both customers and attackers, and how  Azure DDoS Protection filters out DDoS attacks.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/media/2-network-flow.png)
- [[Azure DDoS Protection]] service protects at layer 3 ([[Network layer]]) & layer 4(transport layer)
### Benefits
-**Always-on traffic monitoring**: Your application traffic patterns are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, looking for indicators of DDoS attacks. Azure DDoS Protection instantly and automatically mitigates the attack, once it's detected. As part of the mitigation, traffic sent to the protected resource is redirected by the DDoS protection service and several checks are performed. Azure DDoS Protection drops attack traffic and forwards the remaining traffic to its intended destination. Within a few minutes of attack detection, you're notified using Azure Monitor metrics.
- **Adaptive real time tuning**: Intelligent traffic profiling learns your application's traffic over time, and selects and updates the profile that is the most suitable for your service. The profile adjusts as traffic changes over time.
- **DDoS Protection telemetry, monitoring, and alerting**: Azure DDoS Protection exposes rich telemetry via Azure Monitor. You can configure alerts for any of the Azure Monitor metrics that DDoS Protection uses. You can integrate logging with Azure Event Hubs, Azure Monitor logs, and Azure Storage for advanced analysis via the Azure Monitor Diagnostics interface.
