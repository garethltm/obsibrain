Recommendations are the result of assessing your resources against the relevant policies and identifying resources that aren't meeting your defined requirements.

[[Microsoft Defender for Cloud]] periodically analyzes the compliance status of your resources to identify potential security misconfigurations and weaknesses. It then provides you with recommendations on how to remediate those issues. Defender for Cloud makes its security recommendations based on your chosen initiatives and the [[Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)]] default initiative. When a policy from an initiative is compared against your resources and finds one or more that aren't compliant, it's presented as a recommendation in Defender for Cloud.

Recommendations are actions for you to take to secure and harden your resources. Each recommendation provides you with the following information:

- A short description of the issue
- The remediation steps to carry out in order to implement the recommendation
- The affected resources

Security recommendations contain details that help you understand its significance and how to handle it.
