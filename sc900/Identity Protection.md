[[Microsoft Entra ID]] Protection helps organizations detect, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks. These identity-based risks can be further fed into tools like [[Conditional Access]] to make access decisions or fed back to a [[security information and event management (SIEM)]] tool for further investigation and correlation.

### Detect risks
- Detect risky behaviorsâ€¯like:
	- Anonymous IP address usage
	- Password spray attacks
		- Leaked credentials
		- and more...
	During each sign-in, ID Protection runs all real-time sign-in detections generating a sign-in session risk level, indicating how likely the sign-in is compromised. Based on this risk level, policies are then applied to protect the user and the organization.
### Investigate risks
