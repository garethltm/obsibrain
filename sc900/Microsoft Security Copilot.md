- [[Microsoft Entra ID]] integrates with [[Microsoft Security Copilot]]

Business that are onboarded to Copilot & whose users have the appropriate role permissions can take advantage of this integration by enabling the Microsoft Entra plugin
![Screen capture of the Entra plugin in Microsoft Security Copilot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-identity-protection-governance-capabilities/media/entra-plugin.png)
- With the Entra plugin enabled, security analysts can instantly get 
	- a risk summary
	- steps to remediate
	- recommended guidance for each identity at risk

Analysts can use Copilot to guide in the creation of a lifecycle workflow to streamline the process of creating & issuing user credentials & access rights. These & many other Entra capabilities are supported by Copilot

[[Microsoft Entra ID]] capabilities in Copilot are built-in prompts that you can use but you can also enter your own prompts based on the capabilities supported![Screen capture of the Entra capabilities that can be run in the standalone experience.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-identity-protection-governance-capabilities/media/entra-skills.png)

Microsoft Entra integration with Copilot can also be experienced through embedded experience, referred to as Microsoft Copilot in [[Microsoft Entra ID]]

> #Example the risky user's report, available from the Microsoft Entra admin center under Identity protection, embeds the capabilities of [[Microsoft Security Copilot]] to summarize a user's risk level, provide insights relevant to the incident at hand, & provide recommendations for rapid mitigation

Copilot is built using Azure OpenAI Services & is designed to integrate with existing security tools & processes, making it easier for organizations to improve their overall security posture. Azure OpenAI Services provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful large language models (LLMs) for [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], while providing security capabilities of Microsoft Azure.

With access to the powerful LLMs for [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], Copilot is able to read, decipher & make sense of human languages, enabling users to securely interact with it using natural language. Although the LLMs are trained on a vast amount of information that endows Copilot with broad general knowledge and problem solving abilities, itâ€™s not enough. Security analysts expect their copilot to be trained on security and that is where the integration with existing security tools and processes comes into play.
### Integration with Security-specific sources
Copilot combines powerful LLMs with security-specific sources from Microsoft.
