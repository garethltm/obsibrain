is commonly defined as an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system to cause damage or harm. But only thinking of computers or computer systems, in a traditional sense, is limiting. The reality is that a [[cyberattack(s)]] can occur on almost any modern digital device. The impact can range from an inconvenience for an individual to global economic and social disruption.

An attacker can use people, computers, phones, applications, messages, and system processes to carry out an attack. Individuals, organizations, institutions, and governments can be victims of an attack. These attackers might:
- Lock data and processes, and demand a ransom.
- Remove vital information to cause serious harm.
- Steal information.
- Publicly expose private information.
- Stop vital business processes and systems from running, to cause disruption and malfunction.

With cyberattacks continuously evolving, it's important for you to remember that attackers don't exclusively need a computer to carry out an attack. Also, attacks can vary widely in their nature and scope. Any digitally connected device or entity can be used as part of an attack, or be subject to an attack.
