[[network(s)]] exist to help make device-to-device or system-to-system communication easier. Whatever the size of data, it all needs to be broken down into tiny, uniform chunks. These chunks are called datagrams but are also more commonly known as [[packet(s)]].

Imagine that you want to stream a movie to your device. Given the enormous size of the data involved, the streaming server can't give you the whole movie in one go. Instead, the movie is broken up into billions of packets. Each [[packet(s)]] contains a small part of the movie, which is then sent to your device. Your device has to wait until enough [[packet(s)]]have been received before you can start watching the movie. In the background, the server continues to send a steady stream of [[packet(s)]] to your device just ahead of what's being displayed. If your network speed slows down, then the packets may not reach you in time. The picture you see might become distorted or blocky and there may be gaps in the sound.
