is a [[payload]] that locks systems or data until the victim has paid a ransom. Suppose there's an unidentified vulnerability in a network of connected devices. A [[cybercriminal(s)]] can exploit this to access and then encrypt all files across this network. The attacker then demands a ransom in return for decrypting the files. They might threaten to remove all of the files if the ransom hasn't been paid by a set deadline.
