is a type of [[payload]] that joins a computer, server, or another device to a network of similarly infected devices that can be controlled remotely to carry out some nefarious action. A common application of [[botnet]] [[malware]] is crypto-mining (often referred to as crypto-mining malware). In this case, the [[malware]] connects a device to a botnet that consumes the device's computing power to mine or generate cryptocurrencies. A user might notice their computer is running slower than normal and getting worse by the day.
