The goal of Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is to provide a platform for data governance and to drive business value creation in your organization. It does this through a rich set of features that align to data governance principles. The sections that follow describe some of the key features of the [[Microsoft Purview Data Catalog]].

### Governance domains
Governance domains are a new way of organizing your data estate through business concepts, like Marketing or Finance, providing context for your data assets. A governance domain is a boundary that enables the common governance, ownership, and discovery of data products and business concepts like glossary terms, OKRs, or critical data. You can establish many kinds of boundaries such as:
- Fundamental business areas - human resources, sales, finance, supply chain, etc.
- Overarching subject areas - product, parties, etc.
- Boundaries based on organizational functions - customer experience, cloud supply chain, business intelligence, etc.

Business domains are connected to several other business concepts that are incorporated as features of the Data Catalog.
### [[Data product]]
Related to business domains are [[data . 

A governance domain can house many data products but a data product is managed by a single governance domain and can be discovered across many domains.

A successful data product makes it easy for data consumers to recognize valuable data using their day-to-day language, and at the same time streamlines ownership responsibilities for those data assets.

Consider the example where a data scientist has created a set of data assets to be used by a data model and to be used by others. Although the data scientist can use the data catalog to add a glossary term to all the relevant data assets and can add a description to each asset to make it more relevant in search for similar information, it doesn't guarantee that a data consumer would know what glossary term to use or that the data consumer will find all the data assets. This is where a data product fits nicely. The data scientist creates a data product that lists all the assets used to create their data model. The description provides a full use case, with examples or suggestions on how to use the data. The data scientist is now a data product owner and they've improved their data consumer's search experience by helping them get everything they need in this one data product.
