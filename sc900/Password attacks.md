A password attack is when someone attempts to use [[sc900/Authentication|Authentication]] for a password-protected account to gain unauthorized access to a device or system. Attackers often use software to speed up the process of cracking and guessing passwords. 
>For example, suppose an attacker has somehow discovered someone's username for their work account.

The attacker then tries a vast number of possible password combinations to access the userâ€™s account. The password only has to be correct once for the attacker to get access. This is known as a brute force attack and is one of many ways in which a [[cybercriminal(s)]] can use password attacks.
