A common application of [[hashing]] is in digital signing. Like a signature on a piece of paper, a digital signature validates that the document bears the signature, which actually comes from the person who signed it. Additionally, a digital signature is used to validate that the document hasn't been tampered with.
### How does a [[digital signature]] work?
A [[digital signature]] will always be unique to each person signing a document, much like one that's been handwritten. All digital signatures use an asymmetric key pair: the private and public keys.

Using a digital signing service, Monica can assign a digital signature to the document to prove that it hasn’t changed. Signing the document creates a time-stamped hash for it. This hash is then encrypted using Monica’s private key. Next, the signing service appends the hash to the original document, which isn't encrypted. Finally, both the digitally signed document and Monica’s public key are sent to Victoria.

When Victoria receives the digitally signed document, she uses the same digital signing service to extract Monica’s hash from the document, and generate a fresh hash for the original plaintext document. Then, using Monica’s public key, the encrypted hash is decrypted. If Monica’s decrypted hash matches the one Victoria created for the document, then the digital signature is valid. Victoria then knows that the document hasn’t been tampered with.
