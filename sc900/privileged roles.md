[[Microsoft Entra ID]] has roles and permissions that are identified as privileged. These roles and permissions can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, [[authentication]] or [[authorization]] policies, or access restricted data. Privileged role assignments can lead to elevation of privilege if not used in a secure and intended manner.![Screenshot of the Microsoft Entra roles and administrators page that shows the Privileged and Assignments columns.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/media/privileged-roles-permissions/privileged-roles-portal.png)
