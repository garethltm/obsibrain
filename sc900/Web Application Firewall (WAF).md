Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring.

[[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. A centralized [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] helps make security management simpler, improves the response time to a security threat, and allows patching a known vulnerability in one place, instead of securing each individual web application. A [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] also gives application administrators better assurance of protection against threats and intrusions.

Among the types of threats that [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] can protect against are [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks that occur at the application layer. While [[Azure DDoS Protection]] services protect customers against [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks that can occur at the network and transport layers, [[Azure Web Application Firewall]] protects web applications against application-layer [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]] attacks, such as HTTP Floods. These defenses can prevent attackers from reaching your application and affecting your application's availability and performance.![Diagram showing how the Web Application Firewall provides protection against common exploits.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/media/2-web-app-firewall.png)
