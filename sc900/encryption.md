is the mechanism by which [[plaintext]] messages are turned into unreadable [[ciphertext]]. The use of encryption enhances the _[[confidentiality]]_ of data being shared with your recipient, whether they're a friend, a work colleague, or another business.

To facilitate the [[encryption]] and [[decryption]] process, you need to use a secret [[encryption]] key. This key is much like the one you’d use to open your car, or the door to your house. Encryption keys come in two flavors:
- [[Symmetric keys]]
- [[Asymmetric keys]]
## Types of encryption
There are several different types of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and new versions are being invented all the time. Here are some that you may encounter:
- **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** and **Triple-DES**. This was one of the first symmetric encryption standards used.
- **Advanced encryption standard (AES)**. AES replaced DES and Triple DES, and is still widely used today.
- **RSA**. This was one of the first asymmetric encryption standards, and variations are still being used today.
## Where is [[encryption]] used?
[[Encryption]] is used worldwide in almost every facet of our lives, from making a call on your smartphone to using your credit card for a purchase in a shop. [[Encryption]] is used even more when you browse the web.

_Web browsing_ - you may not realize it, but every time you go to a website where the address starts with HTTPS, or there is a padlock icon, encryption is being used. In the address bar for this web page, you will notice it starts with https://. Similarly, when you connect to your bank through the web or make an online purchase where you provide sensitive information, such as a credit card number, you should make sure you see https:// in the address bar.

_Device encryption_ – many operating systems provide tools to enable encryption of hard drives and portable devices. For example, Windows BitLocker, a feature of the Windows operating system, provides encryption for your PC hard drive or portable drives that may connect via USB.

_Messaging applications_ – some commonly known and available messaging applications encrypt messages.

_Mobile communications_ - whether you're using a smartphone or other mobile communications device, encryption is used to securely register it with the nearest mast or cell tower. This ensures you always have the best signal strength.
