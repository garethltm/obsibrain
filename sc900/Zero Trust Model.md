- assume everything is open & untrusted network (even resources behind the firewalls of the corporate network)

### 3 guiding principles
1. Verify explicitly - always authenticate & authorize based on the available data points
	- user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification & anomalies)
2. Least privileged access - limit user access
	- just-in-time & just-enough access (JIT/JEA)
	- risk-based adaptive policies & data protection to protect both data & productivity.
3. Assume breach - segment access by network, user, devices & application.
	- use encryption to protect data
	- use analytics to get visibility, detect threats and improve security

### 6 foundation pillars
1. Identities: Verify all identities (users, services, devices) with strong authentication and least privilege access.
2. Devices: Monitor device health and compliance to secure the large attack surface they create.
3. Applications: Discover and manage all applications, including Shadow IT, and control permissions and access.
4. Data: Classify, label, and encrypt data to protect it across all environments.
5. Infrastructure: Assess and secure infrastructure (on-premises or cloud) using telemetry to detect and respond to threats.
6. Networks: Segment networks and use real-time threat protection, encryption, monitoring, and analytics.
