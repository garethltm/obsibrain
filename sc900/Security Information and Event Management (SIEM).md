A [[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]] system is a tool that an organization uses to collect data from across the whole estate, including infrastructure, software, and resources. It does analysis, looks for correlations or anomalies, and generates alerts and incidents.

SIEM solutions collect, aggregate, and analyze data from various sources within an organization in real time. By consolidating this data into a unified platform, they provide a comprehensive view of the organizationâ€™s security posture. This empowers Security Operation Centers (SOC) to:

- Detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents swiftly.
- Gain visibility into security by centralizing data from different sources.
- Identify potential security breaches and threats in real time.
- Investigate and resolve security incidents efficiently.
- Comply with regulatory and industry-specific security standards.

SIEM solutions are beneficial for organizations of all sizes, helping them maintain robust security and compliance.
