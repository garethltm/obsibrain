Traditionally, if someone's password or username is compromised, this allows a [[cybercriminal(s)]] to gain control of the account. But [[multifactor authentication]] was introduced to combat this.

[[Multifactor authentication]] works by requiring a user to provide multiple forms of identification to verify that they are who they claim to be. The most common form of identification used to verify or authenticate a user is a password. This represents something the user knows.

Two other authentication methods provide something the user _is_, such as a fingerprint or retinal scan (a biometric form of authentication), or provide something the user _has_, such as a phone, hardware key, or other trusted device. [[Multifactor authentication]] employs two or more of these forms of proof to verify a valid user.

>For example, a bank might require a user to provide security codes sent to their mobile device, in addition to their username and password, to access their online account.
