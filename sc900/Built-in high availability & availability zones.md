[[Azure Firewall]] has built-in high [[Availability]], meaning it's designed to ensure continuous operation and minimal downtime, even in the event of failures or high traffic loads. [[Azure Firewall]] can be configured to span multiple [[Availability Zone]](s) where each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Azure Firewall's support for availability zones ensures higher [[availability]] and resilience by distributing resources across these separate zones.
