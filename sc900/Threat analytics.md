helps you, as an analyst, understand how emerging threats impact your organization's environment.

Threat analytics reports provide an analysis of a tracked threat and extensive guidance on how to defend against that threat. It also incorporates data from your network, indicating whether the threat is active and if you have applicable protections in place. You can filter and search on reports, but Defender TI also provides a dashboard.

The threat analytics dashboard highlights the reports that are most relevant to your organization. It summarizes the threats into three categories:
- Latest threats
	- Lists the most recently published or updated threat reports, along with the number of active and resolved alerts.
- High-impact threats
	- Lists the threats that have the highest impact to your organization. This section lists threats with the highest number of active and resolved alerts first.
- Highest exposure - Lists threats to which your org has the highest exposure. Your exposure level to a threat is calculated using two pieces of information: how severe the vulnerabilities associated with the threat are, and how many devices in your organization could be exploited by those vulnerabilities.

Each report provides an overview, an analyst report, related incidents, impacted assets, endpoints exposure, and recommended actions.T
