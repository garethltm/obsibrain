[[Microsoft Purview]] Compliance Manager that helps you automatically assess and manage compliance across your multicloud environment. Compliance Manager can help you throughout your compliance journey, from taking inventory of your data protection risks to managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications, and reporting to auditors.

Compliance Manager helps simplify compliance and reduce risk by providing:
- Prebuilt assessments based on common regional and industry regulations and standards. Admins can also use custom assessment to help with compliance needs unique to the organization.
- Workflow capabilities that enable admins to efficiently complete risk assessments for the organization.
- Step-by-step improvement actions that admins can take to help meet regulations and standards relevant to the organization. Some actions are managed for the organization by Microsoft. Admins get implementation details and audit results for those actions.
- Compliance score, which is a calculation that helps an organization understand its overall compliance posture by measuring how it's progressing with improvement actions.

The Compliance Manager dashboard shows the current compliance score, helps admins to see what needs attention, and guides them to key improvement actions.
