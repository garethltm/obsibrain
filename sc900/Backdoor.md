is a [[payload]] that enables a [[cybercriminal(s)]] to exploit a vulnerability in a system or device to bypass existing security measures and cause harm. Imagine that a [[cybercriminal(s)]] infiltrates a software developing company and leaves some code that allows them to carry out attacks. This becomes a [[backdoor]] that the [[cybercriminal(s)]] could use to hack into the application, the device it's running on, and even the organization's and customers' networks and systems.
