A trojan horse attack gets its name from classical history, where soldiers hid inside a wooden horse that was presented as a gift to the Trojans. When the Trojans brought the wooden horse into their city, the soldiers emerged from hiding and attacked. In the context of cybersecurity, a trojan is a type of malware that pretends to be a genuine piece of software. When a user installs the program, it can pretend to be working as advertised, but the program also secretly performs malicious actions such as stealing information.
