Authentication attacks occur when someone tries to steal another person's credentials. They can then pretend to be that person. Because an objective of these types of attacks is to impersonate a legitimate user, they can also often be referred to as identity attacks. Common attacks include, but are not limited to:
- [[Brute force attack]]
- Dictionary attack
- Credential stuffing
- Keylogging
- Social engineering
