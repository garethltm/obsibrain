Asymmetric encryption was developed in the 1970s. It addresses the secure distribution and proliferation of keys that are associated with symmetric encryption.

Asymmetric encryption changed the way cryptographic keys were shared. Rather than one encryption key, an asymmetric key is composed of two elements, a **private key** and a **public key**, which form a **key pair**. The public key, as the name suggests, can be shared with anyone, so individuals and organizations don’t need to worry about its secure distribution.

The private key must be kept safe. It's looked after only by the person who generated the key pair and isn't shared with anyone. A user who needs to encrypt a message would use the public key, and only the person holding the private key could decrypt it.
