[[Microsoft Defender for Cloud]] is a cloud-native application platform (CNAPP) with a set of security measures & practices designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats & vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud combines the capabilities of:
- A development security operations ([[development security operations (DevSecOps)]]) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud & multiple-pipeline environments
- A cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution that surfaces actions that you can take to prevent breaches.
- A cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) with specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads.![A s=diagram showing the three pillars fo Microsoft Defender for Cloud:  DevOps security management, cloud security posture management, and cloud workload protection platform.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-security-management-capabilities-of-azure/media/defender-for-cloud-pillars-inline.png)
