Any attack that results in someone gaining unauthorized access to devices, services, or networks is considered a security breach. Imagine a security breach as similar to a break-in where an intruder (attacker) successfully breaks into a building (a device, application, or network).

Security breaches come in different forms, including the following:
1. [[Social engineering attacks]]
2. [[Browser attacks]]
3. [[Password attacks]]
