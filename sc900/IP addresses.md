When you want to send a letter to a friend, you'll first write it out before putting it in an envelope. Next you'll write your friend's address on the envelope before posting it. The postal service collects the letter, and through various sorting offices, eventually delivers it.

[[network(s)]] operate in a similar manner. The message is contained in the [[datagram (packet)]], like an envelope. Then the sender and recipient addresses are added to the packet.

The primary function of the Internet Protocol (IP) is to ensure that every device on a network can be uniquely identified. Before a packet is sent across the network, it must be told the IP address of where it's going, and the IP address of where it's come from.

There are presently two standards of IP address: the [[Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)]] and the [[Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)]]. The details are beyond the scope of this module, but the most common type of IP address, and the one you may be familiar with, is [[Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)]]. This is made up of four groups of digits separated by a dot, for example: 127.100.0.1.
