## Reasons to use
Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting access an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource.

However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in [[Microsoft Entra ID]], Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure and Microsoft Entra resources and can oversee what those users are doing with their privileged access.
