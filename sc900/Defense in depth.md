- layered approach to security (to slow the advance of an attack)

### Layers
![Diagram showing defense in depth layers of security which are used to protect sensitive data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/4-defense-depth.png)
- Physical Security - limit access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel
- Identity & Access - MFA
- Perimeter - DDoS Protection
- Network - Network segmentation & Network Access Controls (limit communication between resources)
- Compute - Securing VMs by closing ports
- Application - Ensure applications are free from vulnerabilities
- Data - Manage access & Encryption to protect data

## [[Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)]]

- Confidentiality - keep confidential sensitive data (customer information, passwords, financial data). Should encrypt data to keep it confidential.
- Integrity - keeping data or messages correct. When encrypted it should be the same data.
- Availability - make data available to those and
