- helps IT departments control access to sensitive data and functions, ensuring that only authorized users can access necessary resources like emails, databases, and applications.
### Key Benefits of IAM:
- **Secure Access**: Provides verified entities with secure access to company resources with minimal interference.
- **Access Control**: Ensures that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right time.
- **Broad Coverage**: Extends secure access to employees, contractors, vendors, business partners, and personal devices.
- **Cybersecurity**: Plays a critical role in an organization’s cybersecurity by preventing unauthorized access.

IAM systems enable organizations to quickly and accurately verify identities and permissions during each access attempt, making it an essential component of modern IT infrastructure.
### How does [[Identity and Access Management (IAM)]] work?
1. **Identity Management**: This involves maintaining an up-to-date database of individuals who should have access to the organization’s resources. This database includes details like employee names, job titles, and contact information. [[Authentication]] is the process of matching login credentials with this database.
    
2. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: For added security, many organizations use MFA, which requires users to verify their identity using an additional method, such as a code sent to their mobile phone or email.
    
3. **Access Management**: Once a user’s identity is authenticated, access management determines what resources they can access based on factors like their job title and security clearance. This process is known as [[authorization]].
    
The goal of IAM systems is to ensure that both authentication and authorization are handled securely and correctly every time someone attempts to access the organization’s resources.
