Organizations of all types require a management solution to manage regulatory, legal, and business-critical records across their corporate data. 

[[Microsoft Purview Records Management]] helps an organization look after their legal obligations. It also helps to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer required to be kept, no longer of value, or no longer required for business purposes. [[Microsoft Purview Records Management]] includes many features, including:

- Labeling content as a record.
- Establishing retention and deletion policies within the record label.
- Triggering event-based retention.
- Reviewing and validating disposition.
- Proof of records deletion.
- Exporting information about disposed items.

When content is labeled as a record, by using a retention label, the following happens:

- Restrictions are put in place to block certain activities.
- Activities are logged.
- Proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period.

To enable items to be marked as records, an administrator sets up retention labels.![An admin can choose for items to be marked as records when configuring a policy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-purview-risk-compliance-governance/media/mark-items-record.png)
