- [[Identity]] has become the new security perimeter that enables organizations to secure their assets![Diagram showing identity as the new security perimeter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-identity-principles-concepts/media/3-identity-new-security-perimeter.png)

### 4 pillars of an identity infrastructure
1. Administration - creation & management/governance of identities for users, devices and services
2. Authentication - how much an IT system need to know about an identity to have sufficient proof
3. Authorization - processing the incoming identity data to determine the level of access
4. Auditing - tracking who does what, when, where and how

In [[Microsoft Entra ID]], there are different types of identities are supported.
1. [[User identities]]
2. [[Workload identities]]
3. [[Device identities]]
4. External identities
5. Hybrid identities
#### What can I assign an [[Identity]] in [[Microsoft Entra ID]]
1. You can assign [[Identity]] to people (humans).
	#Example employees = internal users, customers, consultants, vendors and partners = external users
2. You can assign identities to physical devices such as mobile phones, computers and IoT devices
3. You can assign identities to software-based objects, such as applications, virtual machines, services and containers ([[Workload identities]])[![A block diagram showing the categories of identity types. The categories consist of Workload identities, device identities, and human identities. Workload and device identities are grouped under machine identities.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/identity-types-inline.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/identity-types-expanded.png#lightbox)
