is an attack method that takes advantage of the fact that many people use the same username and password across many sites. Attackers will use stolen credentials, usually obtained after a data breach on one site, to attempt to access other areas. Attackers typically use software tools to automate this process. To prevent [[credential stuffing]], it's important not to reuse passwords, and to change them regularly, particularly after a [[security breach]].
