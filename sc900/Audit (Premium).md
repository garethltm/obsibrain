builds on the capabilities of [[Audit (Standard)]] by providing [[Audit Logs]] retention policies, longer retention of audit records, high-value intelligent insights, and higher bandwidth access to the Office 365 Management Activity API.
- Audit log retention policies. You can create customized audit log retention policies to retain audit records for longer periods of time up to one year (and up to 10 years for users with required add-on license).
- Longer retention of audit records. Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange, OneDrive, and SharePoint audit records are retained for one year by default. Audit records for all other activities are retained for 180 days by default, or you can use audit log retention policies to configure longer retention periods.
- Audit (Premium) intelligent insights. Audit records for intelligent insights can help your organization conduct forensic and compliance investigations by providing visibility to events such as when mail items were accessed, or when mail items were replied to and forwarded, or when and what a user searched for in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. These intelligent insights can help you investigate possible breaches and determine the scope of compromise.
- Higher bandwidth to the Office 365 Management Activity API. Audit (Premium) provides organizations with more bandwidth to access auditing logs through the Office 365 Management Activity API.
