Modern enterprises rely on [[DevOps]] platforms for deployment, including the pipelines and production environments that developers require to be productive. Traditional application security methods didnâ€™t consider the increased attack surface that these pipelines and production environments represent for hackers. But now, with hackers shifting left and targeting these upstream tools, a new approach is needed to secure DevOps platform environments.


Defender for Cloud helps you to incorporate good security practices early during the software development process, or [[development security operations (DevSecOps)]]. You can protect your code management environments and your code pipelines, and get insights into your development environment security posture from a single location. Defender for DevOps, a service available in Defender for Cloud, empowers security teams to manage DevOps security across multi-pipeline environments.
