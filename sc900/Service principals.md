- an [[Identity]] for an application.

For an application to delegate its [[Identity]] and access functions to [[Microsoft Entra ID]], the application must first be registered with [[Microsoft Entra ID]] to enable its integration.
- Once an application is registered, a service principal enables core features such as [[sc900/Authentication|Authentication]] and [[Authorization]] of the application to resources that are secured by the Microsoft Entra [[Tenant]]
