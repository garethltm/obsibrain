is a grouping of interconnected physical components that work together to provide a seamless backbone for all your devices to communicate. The cloud and the internet might seem intangible but even they have physical roots. While there are dozens of parts that help define a network, the ones you're more likely to encounter are: routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and hubs. While most of these are outside the scope of this unit, two are worth calling out.

- The **switch** is the fundamental building block of a modern network. It allows multiple devices to communicate with each other.
- The **router** allows different networks to communicate with each other.
You may have heard of different types of networks, such as wireless networks and local area networks. However, fundamentally, they all fall into one of the following two categories:

- A **private network** is where a level of authentication and authorization is required to access devices and resources, as you might find in your place of work.
- A **public network**, like the internet, is open to any user.
