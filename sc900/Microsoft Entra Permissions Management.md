- a cloud infrastructure [[Entitlement Management]] (CIEM) product that provides comprehensive visibility & control over permissions for any identity & any resource in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) & Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This functionality helps organizations address the [[Zero Trust Model]] principle of least privilege access. Organizations need to consider permissions management as a central piece of their [[Zero Trust Model]] security strategy that includes implementing least privilege access across their entire infrastructure.
## Key reasons
1. Organizations are increasingly adopting multicloud strategy & are struggling with the lack of visibility & the increasing complexity of managing access permissions.
2. With the proliferation of identities & cloud services, the number of high-risk cloud permissions is exploding, expanding the attack surface for organizations.
3. IT security teams are under increased pressure to ensure access to their expanding cloud estate is secure & compliant.
4. The inconsistency of cloud providers' native access management models makes it even more complex for Security & Identity to manage permissions & enforce least privilege access policies across their entire environment.

Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes (remediates), & continuously monitors unused & excessive permissions.

Permissions Management helps organizations address requirements for least access privilege through discovery of the entire infrastructure, remediate that automatically rightsizes for least privilege through discovery of the entire infrastructure, remediation that automatically rightsizes for least privilege access & continuously monitoring the entire infrastructure for unused & excessive permissions.![Screen capture showing the three steps of permissions management: Discover, remediate, and monitor.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-identity-protection-governance-capabilities/media/discover-remediate-monitor.png)
1. Discover
	- Customers can assess permission risks by evaluating the gap between permissions granted & permissions used
		- Cross-cloud permissions discovery - Granular & normalized metrics for key cloudplatforms
		- [[Permission Creep Index (PCI)]]
		- Permissions usage analytics - Multi-dimensional view of risk of all identities, actions & resources
2. Remediate
	- Customer can right-size permissions based on usage, grant new permissions on-demand, & automate just-in-time access for cloud resources
		- Automated deletion of permissions unused for the past 90 days
		- Permissions on-demand - Grant identities permissions on-demand for a time-limited period or on as-needed basis
3. Monitor
	- Customer can detect anomalous activities with machine learning-powered (ML-powered) alerts & generate detailed forensive report
