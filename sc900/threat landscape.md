Whether an organization is large or small, the entirety of the digital landscape with which it interacts represents an entry point for a [[cyberattack(s)]]. These can include:
- Email accounts
- Social media accounts
- Mobile devices
- The organization's technology infrastructure
- Cloud services
- People

Collectively, these are referred to as the [[threat landscape]]. Notice that the [[threat landscape]] can cover more than just computers and mobile phones. It can include any elements that are owned or managed by an organization, or some that are not. As you'll learn next, criminals will use any means they can to mount and carry out an attack.
