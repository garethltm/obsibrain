uses an algorithm, also known as a **hashing function**, to convert the original text to a unique fixed-length value. This is called a hash value. Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced. That hash can then be used as a unique identifier of its associated data.![Diagram showing an example of a hashing function accepting a plaintext message and generating a hash value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-concepts-of-cryptography/media/hashing-function-example.png)

Hashing is different to [[encryption]] in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value can’t decrypt back to the original.

There are many different types of hash functions. One that's common, and you may hear in discussions with security professionals, is the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). SHA is a family of hash algorithms that each work differently. The details are beyond the scope of this content, but one of the more commonly used SHAs is SHA-256, which produces a hash value that is 256 bits long.
