Threat intelligence analysts struggle with balancing a breadth of threat intelligence ingestion with the analysis of which threat intelligence poses the biggest threats to their organization and/or industry. Similarly, vulnerability intelligence analysts battle correlating their asset inventory with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information to prioritize the investigation and remediation of the most critical vulnerabilities associated with their organization.

[[Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI)]] addresses these challenges by aggregating and enriching critical data sources and displaying them in an innovative, easy-to-use interface. Analysts can then correlate indicators of compromise (IOCs) with related articles, actor profiles, and vulnerabilities. Defender TI also lets analysts collaborate with fellow Defender TI-licensed users within their tenant on investigations.

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence functionality includes:
- [[Threat analytics]]
- [[Intel Profiles]]
- [[Intel Explorer]]
- [[Intel Projects]]
