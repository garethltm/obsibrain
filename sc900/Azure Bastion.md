is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. The [[Azure Bastion]] service is a fully platform-managed [[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] service that you provision inside your [[virtual network]]. [[Azure Bastion]] provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal using Transport Layer Security (TLS). When you connect via [[Azure Bastion]], your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.![Diagram showing how a user can make a remote desktop connection to an Azure VM using Azure Bastion.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/media/2-azure-bastion.png)
[[Azure Bastion]] provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all VMs in the [[virtual network]], and peered [[virtual network]](s), in which it's provisioned. Using [[Azure Bastion]] protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH.

[[Azure Bastion]] deployment is per [[virtual network]] with support for virtual network peering, not per subscription/account or virtual machine. Once you provision the Azure Bastion service in your virtual network, the RDP/SSH experience is available to all your VMs in the same VNet, and peered VNets.
