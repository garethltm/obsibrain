is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. The [[Azure Bastion]] service is a fully platform-managed [[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] service that you provision inside your [[virtual network]]. [[Azure Bastion]] provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal using Transport Layer Security (TLS). When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.
