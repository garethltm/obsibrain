Most [[authentication]] attacks involve exploitation of computers or an attempt to try many credential combinations. Social engineering attacks are different in that they exploit the vulnerabilities of humans. The attacker tries to gain the trust of a legitimate user.

A number of social engineering techniques can be used for authentication theft, including:
- **[[Phishing]]**
- **[[Pretexting]]**
- **[[Baiting]]**
