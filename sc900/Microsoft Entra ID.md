- Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service (used to be called Azure Active Directory)
- simplifies the way organizations manage [[Authorization]] and access by providing a single [[Identity]] system for their cloud and on-premises applications.

[[Microsoft Entra ID]] also allows organizations to securely enable the use of personal devices![Diagram showing Microsoft Entra ID as a cloud-based identity provider that works with cloud apps such as M365, devices, and on-premises applications.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/entra-id-general-diagram-v2.png)
