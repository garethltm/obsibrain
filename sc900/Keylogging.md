involves malicious software that logs keystrokes. Using the key logger, an attacker can log (steal) username and password combinations, which can then be used for credential stuffing attacks. This is a common attack at internet cafes or anywhere you use a shared computer for access. To prevent keylogging, don't install untrusted software and use reputable virus-scanning software.

Keylogging isn't limited to just computers. Suppose a bad actor installs a box or device over the card reader and keypad at an ATM. When you insert your card, it passes first through the bad actors card reader - capturing the card details, before feeding it into the ATMs card reader. Now, when you key in your pin using the bad actor's keypad, they get your pin as well.
