We all rely on browsers to access the internet to work and carry out our daily tasks. As you've learned earlier, attackers can compromise poorly secured browsers. A user might download a malicious file or install a malicious add-on that can compromise the browser, the device and even propagate itself into an organization's systems. Organizations can protect against these types of attacks by implementing security policies that:

- Prevent the installation of unauthorized browser extensions or add-ons.
- Only allow permitted browsers to be installed on devices.
- Block certain sites using web content filters.
- Keep browsers up to date.
