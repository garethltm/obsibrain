- is well suited to handling project-based access needs. 
- automates access requests, access assign
- an identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage the identity & access lifecycle at scale. [[Entitlement Management]] automates access request workflows, access assignments, reviews & expiration
1. Users may not know what access they should have, & even if they do, they might have difficulty locating the right individuals to approve it.
2. When users find & receive access to a resource, they may hold on to access longer than is required for business purposes.
3. Managing access for external users

[[Entitlement Management]] includes the following capabilities to address these challenges
1. Delegate the creation of access packages to non-administrators. These access packages contain resources that users can request. The delegated access package managers then define policies that include rules such as which users can request access, who must approve their access & then access expires.
2. Managing external users. When a user isn't yet in your directory requests access, & is approved, they're automatically invited into your directory & assigned access. When their access expires, if they have no other access package assignments, their B2B account in your directory can be automatically removed.
