Defender for Cloud apps is a cloud access security broker that brings deep visibility, strong data controls, and enhanced threat protection to your cloud apps.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps delivers full protection for [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] applications, helping you monitor and protect your cloud app data across the following feature areas:

- Fundamental [[Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)]] functionality. 
    
- [[SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)]] features, enabling security teams to improve the organization’s security posture
    
- Advanced threat protection, as part of Microsoft's extended detection and response (XDR) solution, enabling powerful correlation of signal and visibility across the full kill chain of advanced attacks
    
- App-to-app protection, extending the core threat scenarios to OAuth-enabled apps that have permissions and privileges to critical data and resources.
### Discover [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] applications
[[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps]] shows the full picture of risks to your environment from [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] app usage and resources, and gives you control of what’s being used and when.

- Identify: 
	- Defender for Cloud apps uses data based on an assessment of network traffic and an extensive app catalog to identify apps accessed by users across your organization.
    
- Assess: 
	- Evaluate discovered apps for more than 90 risk indicators, allowing you to sort through the discovered apps and assess your orgs security and compliance posture.
    
- Manage: 
	- Set policies that monitor apps around the clock. 
>		For example, if anomalous behavior happens, like unusual spikes in usage, you're automatically alerted and guided to action.
### Information protection
Defender for Cloud Apps connects to [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] apps to scan for files containing sensitive data uncovering which data is stored where and who is accessing it. To protect this data, organizations can implement controls such as:

- Apply a sensitivity label
- Block downloads to an unmanaged device
- Remove external collaborators on confidential files

The Defender for Cloud Apps integration with [[Microsoft Purview]] also enables security teams to leverage out-of-the-box data classification types in their information protection policies and control sensitive information with data loss protection (DLP) features.
### Advanced threat protection
Cloud apps continue to be a target for adversaries trying to exfiltrate corporate data. Sophisticated attacks often cross modalities. Attacks often start from email as the most common entry point then move laterally to compromise endpoints and identities, before ultimately gaining access to in-app data.

Defender for Cloud Apps offers built-in adaptive access control (AAC), provides user and entity behavior analysis (UEBA), and helps you mitigate these types of attacks.

Defender for Cloud Apps is also integrated directly into [[Microsoft Defender XDR]], correlating eXtended detection and response (XDR) signals from the Microsoft Defender suite and providing incident-level detection, investigation, and powerful response capabilities. Integrating [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] security into Microsoft's XDR experience gives SOC teams full kill chain visibility and improves operational efficiency and effectivity.
