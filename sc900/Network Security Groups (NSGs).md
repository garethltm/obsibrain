let you filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network; for example, a virtual machine. 

A [[Network Security Groups (NSGs)]] consists of rules that define how the traffic is filtered. You can associate only one network security group to each [[virtual network]] [[subnet(s)]] and network interface in a virtual machine. The same [[Network Security Groups (NSGs)]], however, can be associated to as many different [[subnet(s)]] and network interfaces as you choose.

In the highly simplified diagram that follows, you can see an Azure [[virtual network]] with two [[subnet(s)]] that are connected to the internet, and each subnet has a virtual machine. Subnet 1 has an [[Network Security Groups (NSGs)]] assigned to it that's filtering inbound and outbound access to VM1, which needs a higher level of access. In contrast, VM2 could represent a public-facing machine that doesn't require an [[Network Security Groups (NSGs)]].![Diagram showing a simplified virtual network with two subnets each with a dedicated virtual machine resource, the first subnet has a network security group and the second subnet doesn't.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/media/2-virtual-network.png)
