occurs when an attacker sends a seemingly legitimate email with the objective of having a user reveal their [[authentication]] credentials. 
>For example, an email might appear to be from the user’s bank. A link opens to what looks like the bank’s sign-in page, but is actually a fake site. When a user logs in at the fake site, their credentials become available to the attacker. There are several variations of phishing, including spear-phishing, which targets specific organizations, businesses, or individuals.
