Electronic discovery, or eDiscovery, is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases.

eDiscovery is one of the solutions available through the [[Microsoft Purview]] portal, under the Risk & Compliance set of solutions.

The [[Microsoft Purview]] portal presents a unified UI experience for eDiscovery. If you previously worked with [[eDiscovery]] through the [[Microsoft Purview]] compliance portal, a key difference is that you'll no longer experience a different UI for eDiscovery (Standard) and eDiscovery (Premium). Instead, you have one consistent UI and depending on the licensing and subscriptions for your organization, you can further manage cases and analyze content using premium eDiscovery features.

To access any of the eDiscovery-related tools, a user must be assigned the appropriate permissions.
