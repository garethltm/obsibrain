	3. information
	4. technology
	to achieve its goal
- provides a holistic view of the organization $\rightarrow$ effective decision-making, optimization of resources & adaptation to changes in the business environment
- combination of multiple underlying disciplines such as:
	1. Business architecture
	2. IT architecture

## Purpose
- [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] aims to establish a [[EA framework ]]that outlines and organization's structure & operations
	- It is done often through the creation of a [[Business Capabilities]] map or blueprint
- [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] also seeks to foster team alignment & standardization by ***harmonizing environments*** across teams and organizations

## Benefits
1. An ability to:
	1. grasp
	2. store
	3. structure
	4. analyze varied sources of information
	to solve unplanned or foreseeable problems in enterprise landscapes
2. An awareness of industry-relevant technologies and the competence to demonstrate
	- (how a proposed service would impact a company)
3. The influence to implement enterprise-wide [[AGILE]] methodologies to accelerate product deployments & connect siloed organizational groups
4. A clear survey of an enterprise to extend data-driven findings to business leaders in order to prioritize investments and transformational strategies
5. Standardized processes help enterprises not only change for the better but become better at change itself
- If established correctly $\rightarrow$ can add value to organizations through:
	1. enhanced processes
	2. efficiency
	3. decision-making
- However, its adoption is limited due to challenges
## Challenges
- Ambiguous starting points, implementation & governance gaps & the need for ongoing innovation pose obstacles to successful [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] programs.

Most common challenges:
1. Lacking business buy-in
2. Absence of leadership & vision
3. No tool/the wrong tool for the job
4. Too much planning but too little doing
5. Trying to model everything
6. Solving problems on the wrong level
	- This becomes challenging

## Process
- breaking down the starting point into several steps can make the process more manageable:
	1. Define goal & objective
	2. Identify the key stakeholders
	3. Select a modern [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] tool
	4. Assess the current state of IT infrastructure & systems
	5. Develop a future state architecture
		- vision
	6. Create an implementation plan
	7. Monitor progress and adjust the [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] framework
