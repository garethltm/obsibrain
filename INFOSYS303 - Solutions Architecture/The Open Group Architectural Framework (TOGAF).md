- not easy to use
- a method of:
	1. designing
	2. implementing
	3. guiding
	4. maintaining
		the construction of enterprises using controlled phases or as it is known "the Architectural Development Method". It strategies have been iteratively improved upon for 25 years.
- an [[Enterprise Architecture]] methodology & [[framework]] to improve business efficiency
	1. Helps businesses define their goals & align them with architecture objectives around enterprise [[software development]]
	2. Has been used by [[Enterprise Architect (EA)]] as a common language to plot IT development strategies
	3. Was developed in 1995 to help enterprises & [[Enterprise Architect (EA)]] align on cross-departmental projects in a structured manner to facilitate key business objectives

## Fundamental Aim
- to support critical business needs by:
	1. Ensuring that everyone speaks the same language
		- Same understanding
	2. Avoiding lock-in to proprietary solutions by standardizing open methods for [[Enterprise Architecture]]
		- Providing general ways for organizations to follow methods & processes
	3. Saving time & money & utilizing resources more effectively
	4. Achieving demonstrable [[Return-On-Investment (ROI)]]

## Architectural Development Method (ADM)
- [[The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)]] ADM process is specifically designed to accelerate workflow across 4 domains of [[Enterprise Architecture]]
	1. [[Business Architecture]] (High-level conception)
	2. [[Applications Architecture]]
	3. [[Data Architecture]]
	4. [[Technical Architecture]]
## Architecture Development Model
- a clear roadmap for how to create the Architecture Development Method (ADM)
- a 9-phase sequential process
	- throughout the 9-stages of [[The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)]] ADM process
		- the 4-architectural domains become iteratively developed to create a balanced architecture capable of securing organizational changes

- This method is intended to limit guesswork & foster maturity in [[Enterprise Architecture]] programs - all of which while amassing enterprise-specific architectural repositories to support future projects
