- not easy to use
- a method of:
	1. designing
	2. implementing
	3. guiding
	4. maintaining
		the construction of enterprises using controlled phases or as it is known "the Architectural Development Method". It strategies have been iteratively improved upon for 25 years.
- an [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] methodology & framework to improve business efficiency
	1. Helps businesses define their goals & align them with architecture objectives around enterprise [[software development]]
	2. Has been used by [[enterprise architects]] as a common language to plot IT development strategies
	3. Was developed in 1995 to help enterprises & [[enterprise architects]] align on cross-departmental projects in a structured manner to facilitate key business objectives

## Fundamental Aim
- to support critical business needs by:
	1. Ensuring that everyone speaks the same language
		- Same understanding
	2. Avoiding lock-in to proprietary solutions by standardizing open methods for [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]]
		- Providing general ways for organizations to follow methods & processes
	3. Saving time & money & utilizing resources more effectively
	4. Achieving demonstrable [[Return-On-Investment (ROI)]]

## Architectural Development Method (ADM)
- [[The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)]] ADM process is specifically designed to accelerate workflow across 4 domains of [[Enterprise Architecture (EA)]]
	1. Business Architecture (High-level conception)
		- Responsible for mapping the relationships between a business's operational hierarchies, policies, capabilities & initiatives
	2. Applications Architecture
		- Responsible for defining relevant applications 
		- to handle company data & the ways in which to implement & deploy these applications within the overall infrastructure
	3. Data Architecture
		- Responsible for defining the rules & standards to store & integrate data
	4. Technical Architecture
		- Defines platforms, service & all surrounding technology components to serve as a reference for development teams
