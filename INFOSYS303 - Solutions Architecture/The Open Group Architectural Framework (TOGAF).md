- not easy to use
- a method of:
	1. designing
	2. implementing
	3. guiding
	4. maintaining
		the construction of enterprises using controlled phases or as it is known "the [[TOGAF Architectural Development Method (ADM)]]". It strategies have been iteratively improved upon for 25 years.
- an [[Enterprise Architecture]] methodology & [[framework]] to improve business efficiency
	1. Helps businesses define their goals & align them with architecture objectives around enterprise [[software development]]
	2. Has been used by [[Enterprise Architect (EA)]] as a common language to plot IT development strategies
	3. Was developed in 1995 to help enterprises & [[Enterprise Architect (EA)]] align on cross-departmental projects in a structured manner to facilitate key business objectives

## Fundamental Aim
- to support critical business needs by:
	1. Ensuring that everyone speaks the same language
		- Same understanding
	2. Avoiding lock-in to proprietary solutions by standardizing open methods for [[Enterprise Architecture]]
		- Providing general ways for organizations to follow methods & processes
	3. Saving time & money & utilizing resources more effectively
	4. Achieving demonstrable [[Return-On-Investment (ROI)]]

## Architecture Development Model
- a clear roadmap for how to create the [[TOGAF Architectural Development Method (ADM)]]
- a 9-phase sequential process
	- throughout the 9-stages of [[TOGAF Architectural Development Method (ADM)]] process
		- the 4-architectural domains become iteratively developed to create a balanced architecture capable of securing organizational changes

- This method is intended to limit guesswork & foster maturity in [[Enterprise Architecture]] programs - all of which while amassing enterprise-specific architectural repositories to support future projects
