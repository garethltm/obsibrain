- a [[Local Search]] strategy that always selects a [[successor(s)]] that [[minimises]] (or [[maximises]]) a [[heuristic(s)]] function which is typically the loss (or gain) - dependent on what kind of problem you are solving
	>it performs ==[[greedy choice]]==

	[[successor(s)]] A
	A' = argmin h(A') or A' = argmax h(A')
	where h: Sâ†’R is a [[heuristic(s)]] function

### Characteristic:
- Tie break is typically random
