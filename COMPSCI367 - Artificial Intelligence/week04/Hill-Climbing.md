- Have no Frontier
- Will just STOP

- IMPORTANCE of [[Hill-Climbing]] = we always want to improve the VALUE

### Difficulties
- Main problem: depending on [[initial state]], can get stuck in local maxima

> Note: these difficulties apply to all [[Local Search]] algorithms, and usually becomes much worse as the [[search space]] becomes higher dimensional
1. Local maxima
2. Plateaus
3. [[Diagonal ridges]]
