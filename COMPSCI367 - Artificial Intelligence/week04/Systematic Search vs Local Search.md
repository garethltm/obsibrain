[[Systematic Search]] strategies
- [[frontier (open list, fringe)]] maintains **all unexpanded** successors of expanded nodes
- Traverse the search space of a problem instance in a **systematic manner**
- Guarantee **completeness**
    > For example: eventually a [[solution(s)]] is found or determine that the solution does not exist
    
[[Local Search]] strategies
- Frontier maintains **some unexpanded** successors of expanded nodes
- Start at **some state** and “move” from present location(s) to neighbouring location(s). The moves are determined by the present location(s)
- Do **not** guarantee **completeness**
