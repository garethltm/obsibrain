- solve large complex search problems with small memory
	- small memory because you only need to know the [[current state]]
	- maintains & iteratively updates a [[single candidate solution]]

## Steps
1. we start from some initial state
2. perform a number of actions searching for a solution

## Main Idea
- resembling an [[agent]] exploring the search space & move along successor relations
	- AIM: to improve its position in the long run (optimal solution)
