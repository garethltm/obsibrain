- uses the same procedures as [[Hill-Climbing]] with following differences:
	1. When no [[uphill successors]] are present, move "[[sideways]]" 
	2. Introduce a parameter m such that only â‰¤ m steps we can perform  [[sideways]] moves consecutively
		- this solves the shoulder problem
- loop on at maxima
	- limit number of consecutive [[sideways]] steps

		- where we can overcome the shoulder & go up towards global maximum
