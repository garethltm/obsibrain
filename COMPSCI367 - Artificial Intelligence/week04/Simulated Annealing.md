- resembles the [[annealing]] process used to cool metals slowly to reach an ordered (low-energy) state:

## Main Idea
- allow "bad" moves occasionally, depending on "temperature"
- High temperature
	- more bad moves allowed, shake the system out of its local minimum
- Gradually reduce temperature according to some schedule
