- A resolution to the problem of [[Hill-Climbing]] not remembering (because it can end up in the same state)
- it stores a certain amount of states that we visited then adding the most recent & removing the oldes t one
	- which helps to avoi dthe same states twice
- Prevents returning quickly to the same state
	- Keep fixed length queue ("tabu list")
	- Add most recent state to queue; drop oldest
	- Never make the step that is currently "tabu'ed"
