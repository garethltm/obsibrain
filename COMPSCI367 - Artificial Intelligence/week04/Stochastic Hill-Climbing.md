- chooses a random [[state(s)]] from all better [[state(s)]] in the neighbours
		![[First Choice Hill-Climbing]]
	
## Main Idea
- generating all the [[state(s)]] & choosing those that are going uphill (choosing the best moves)
	- random selection among the uphill moves
	- The selection probability can vary with the steepness of the uphill move
- Can ==still get stuck in local maxima==
