- [[Multi-agent]] environment
- conducts search by maintaining a [[population]]

### Advantages
- Search diversification
	- which may lead to a higher chance of finding a better solution
- Combination of promising traits in different [[candidate solution]]
	- [[Multi-agent]] may share the same information
		> 1 [[agent]] finds shit path; Another one find a good path
		> 		Shit path = We redeploy the agent to a good path - this could give a possibility of combining promising traits in different [[candidate solution]] - by joining the information that we find: we can easily find a better solution

## Strategies
1. Local beam Search
2. Genetic Algorithm
