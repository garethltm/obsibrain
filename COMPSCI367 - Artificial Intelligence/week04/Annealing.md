- metallurgical process where molten metals are slowly cooled to allow them to reach a low energy state, making them stronger

### High temperature
- thermodynamic movement tends to be more random

### Low temperature
- little random movements

> annealing process would start by keeping metal above its recrystallisation temperature for while before letting it cool down

> same idea for [[Local Search]] where we want to get out of local maximum/minimum
