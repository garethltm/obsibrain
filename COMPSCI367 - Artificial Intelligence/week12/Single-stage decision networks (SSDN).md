A [[Structured Representation]] which represents [[Dependency]] relations among (decision & random variables)
	- reflecting everything in a graph

An extension of a [[Bayesian Networks]] with 3 nodes:
1. [[Decision nodes]]
2. [[Chance nodes]]
3. A single [[utility]] node, represents the [[utility]]
>>	The [[Chance nodes]] take the same tole as nodes in a [[Bayesian Networks]] with [[Local Markov Property]]
