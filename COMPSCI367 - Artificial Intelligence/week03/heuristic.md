- a solution to relaxed problems, where some of the constraints of the original problem have been removed

## Main idea
- in an ideal scenario where there are no limitation, what is the best possible solution

### Summary
- [[Admissible heuristic]]
- Comparing heuristics
> Good heuristics can help A* Search algorithm to find the solution faster
