If there is only 1 variable, return the intersection of its (unary [[constraint(s)]])

Otherwise:
- select a variable $X$
- join the [[constraint(s)]] in which $X$ appears, forming [[constraint(s)]] $R1$
- project $R1$ onto its variables other than $X$, forming $R2$
- replace all of the [[constraint(s)]] in which $X$ appears by $R2$
- recursively solve the simplified problem, forming $R3$
- return $R1$ joined with $R3$

> we want to construct a graph that represents the [[Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs)]]; we want to eliminate the variables & introduce a new [[constraint(s)]] that doesnâ€™t involve it
