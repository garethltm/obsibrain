- Constraint Satisfaction Problems are defined by a set of variables $Xi$, each with a domain $Di$ of possible values, and a set of [[constraint(s)]] C that specify **allowable combinations of values**

## Main Idea
The aim is to find an assignment of the variables $Xi$ from the domains $Di$ in such a way that none of the [[constraint(s)]] C are violated
> Example: all of the [[constraint(s)]] C are satisfied

![[Pasted image 20231023160732.png]]- Variables:
    - WA, NT, Q, NSW, V, SA, T
- Domains:
    
    - $Di = {red, green, blue}$
- Constraints:
    
    - adjacent regions must have different colours
