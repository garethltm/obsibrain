- Constraint Satisfaction Problems are defined by a set of variables $Xi$, each with a domain $Di$ of possible values, and a set of [[const]] C that specify **allowable combinations of values**

## Main Idea
The aim is to find an assignment of the variables $Xi$ from the domains $Di$ in such a way that none of the constraints C are violated
> Example: all of the constraints C are satisfied
