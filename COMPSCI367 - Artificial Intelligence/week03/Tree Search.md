## Extra Work
- Failure to detect repeated states can cause exponentially more work![[Pasted image 20231023153758.png]]
- LEFT: [[Search Tree]] generated by exploring the search tree on the RIGHT 
- RIGHT: Different nodes, you can reach those nodes by travelling a different [[path(s)]]

If you apply [[Search Techniques (Search Strategy) (Search Algorithm)]], you might get repeated states; It will then grow **EXPONENTIALLY**
- If we apply [[Breadth-First Search (BFS)]], we shouldn’t bother expanding the circled node

- We wouldn’t need to explore e, a, p, q because they have already been explored at a lower depth
