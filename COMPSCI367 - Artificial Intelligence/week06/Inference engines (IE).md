- algorithms that generate new [[constraint(s)]]/facts from [[Percepts]] & [[Knowledge Base (KB)]]
- decides for any [[Knowledge Base (KB)]], a set of [[Percepts]] [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]] [[Percepts]], & [[proposition]] g, whether
$$ KB \cup Percepts\ \vDash g$$
	The [[proposition]] g is called a query where it is the [[logical consequence]] of $KB \cup Percepts$
