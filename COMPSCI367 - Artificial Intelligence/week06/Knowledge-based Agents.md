- [[Inference Engine Example]] scenario needs a [[Structured Representation]] to code [[constraint(s)]] & [[Percepts]], & to perform [[inference(s)]]
## Consists
1. [[Offline]] - stores previously held [[constraint(s)]]
2. [[Online]] - generate new 

## Implements
1. [[Knowledge Base (KB)]]
2. [[Knowledge Base (KB)]] is updated through an [[Inference engines (IE)]]
