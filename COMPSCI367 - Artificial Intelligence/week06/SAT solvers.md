- [[Satisfiability Problem (SAT)]] 
- Feeding this [[proposition]] to a [[SAT solvers]] which produces a [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]]

### Efficient implementations
- [[DPLL algorithm]]
- [[Local Search]] - use the number of unsatisfied [[clause(s)]] as the evaluation function
	- [[Greedy Descent]]
	- [[Simulated Annealing]]
