- [[Logic Inference Problem]] & [[Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs)]]
- for [[proposition]] $\alpha$ & $\beta$, 
	- $\alpha \vDash \beta$ if & only if $\alpha \land \neg \beta$ is not [[satisfiable]]
- Thus, techniques for [[Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSPs)]] can be used for [[Satisfiability Problem (SAT)]]
