- If [[Knowledge Base (KB)]] is infinite (possibly KB’), you can always find a subset of that KB which leads to the same [[sentence]] - YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT INFINITE SENTENCES (Generalising?)
- Propositionalization → Applying grounding rules to introduce propositions to KB & eliminate the quantifiers
    - if proof not found, repeat again to generate more propositions
    - when will you stop?
