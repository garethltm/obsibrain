- a tuple $$(D,R1,R2,...,Rk,f1,...,fl)$$
where 
- D is a set of elements & is called the domain (we are using a set of nouns)
- Each $Ri$ where $1 \le i \le k$ is a relation (or predicates), of certain arity $ri$ 
	($unary:ri = 1, binary:ri = 2$), defined on D
	> $Ri$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $D^ri$
	- Number of possible relations
- Each $fi$ where $1 \le i \le l$ is a function (of certain arity $si$) defined on D,
>	$fi : D^si \rightarrow D$
