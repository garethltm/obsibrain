Let S be a [[signature]]
The set of [[term(s)]] T are defined as follows:
- Every variable is a [[term(s)]] in T
- Every constant symbol is a [[term(s)]] in T
	>(1,1); (2,2)
- If $t0,t1,t2,...,tr-1$ are [[term(s)]] & f is a function symbol in S with arity r, then $f(t0,t1,t2,...,tr-1)$ is a [[term(s)]] in T
