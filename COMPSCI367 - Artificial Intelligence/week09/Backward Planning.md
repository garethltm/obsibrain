start from [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] & checking whether you reach the [[initial state (start state)]]

### Action Scheme
1. `action a` is relevant to `goal g` if it satisfies **one or both** of these conditions:
    - at least 1 of `action a` â€™s effects (can be + or -) unifies with an element of `goal g`
    - none of `action a` â€˜s effects (can be + or -) negates an element of `goal g`
	    
	    <aside> ðŸ’¡ as long as there is an effect that doesnâ€™t go away from the goal</aside>
    - In this case, we write `action a` âˆˆ `Relevant(g)`
    
2. regressed subgoal â†’ from `goal g` over `action a` is:
    - `Regress(g,a)` = (`goal g` \ `Add(a)`) âˆª `Precond(a)`
