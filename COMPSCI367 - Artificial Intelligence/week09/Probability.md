imagine a very large number n of possible [[worlds]] which an event has had an opportunity to occur:
- k → number of [[worlds]] in which the event has occurred
- n-k → number of [[worlds]] in which the event hasn’t occurred
- k/n → [[probability]] of the event

1. 0 is event certain not to occur
2. 1 is event certain to occur
which leads to [[Probability Theory]]
