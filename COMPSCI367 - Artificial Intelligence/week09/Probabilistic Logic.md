[[Probability Theory]] 
[[logic]] & [[inference(s)]] gives us tools for reliably reasoning about representations of the world

### Applications
- more flexible versions of logic-based systems
>	robot path planning $\rightarrow$ do not have certainty but needs constraints on errors

- [[Probabilistic Parsing]]
>	some parsing patterns/group of words are more or less likely to happen/happen together

- Information extraction & integration
> 	is the information you wanted to extract present?

- Activity recognition; scene recognition (but Deep Learning) - classifying things
>	do you have enough evidence to recognise the activity/scene

- [[inference(s)]]
