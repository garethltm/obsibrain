- a theory that gives us tools for reliably reasoning about [[uncertainty]]
- is a [[calculus of belief]]
>	There is a 80% [[probability]] of raining expresses a belief based on past experience
- [[Probability Theory]] is the study of how [[knowledge]] affects [[degree of belief]]
	- new [[evidence]], revise your belief
- The [[probability]] of a hypothesis $\alpha$ is a scale of the [[agent(s)]]'s belief in $\alpha$ in the range [0,1] 
	- 0 is no chance to occur
	- 1 is certain to occur

The sample space $\ohm$ over these [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]] contains all possible [[interpretation]].

A [[proposition]] describes a [[constraint(s)]] on [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]]
>	#Example 
1. $\alpha \tiny 1\normalsize: \neg Hot$
>		$e \tiny 2\normalsize \ e \tiny 4\normalsize$ basically says that it is NOT Hot

>				either one of them is False
