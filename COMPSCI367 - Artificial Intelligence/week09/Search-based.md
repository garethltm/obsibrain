- [[State Space]]
- [[plan]] are [[path(s)]] from [[initial state (start state)]] to [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]]

>[[Planning]] vs [[search]]
>	main difference = [[state(s)]] representation
- [[Planning]] (typically the [[Structured Representation]])
	- [[state(s)]]: structural information used by [[Classical Planning]] [[algorithm]]
- [[search]]  (typically the [[Atomic Representation]])
	- [[state(s)]]: single entity used by the [[search]] [[algorithm]]
