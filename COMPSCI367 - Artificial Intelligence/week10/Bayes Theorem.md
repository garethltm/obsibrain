$$P(A\ |\ B) = \frac {P(B\ |\ A)\ \cdot\ P(A)}{P(B)}$$
- $A$ is an event with probability $P(A)$
	- like throwing a 6 on a 10 sided die
		- if you are planning to roll a 6 altogether; if you roll a 2, the [[probability]] of rolling a 4 is going to change
- $B$ is another event 
	- like throwing a 6 on another 10 sided die
- $P(A\ |\ B)$ is the [[conditional probability]] 

> they are independent events, the outcome of 1 doesn't necessarily impacts the outcome of the another
