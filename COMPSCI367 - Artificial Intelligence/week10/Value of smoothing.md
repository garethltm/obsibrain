- Also called shrinkage, since it shifts the [[probability]] distribution towards a uniform distribution
	- assumes your sample is not the representative of the real world
- This amounts to saying that we think the training data contains limited information about the true distribution
	- trying to avoid [[overfitting]]
- If we hadn't used [[Laplace smoothing (add-one smoothing)]] in our language ID example, what would have happened?
	- sample did not contain some of the terms that is used for the search string
		- there would then be 0s which would lead the end product to be 0
