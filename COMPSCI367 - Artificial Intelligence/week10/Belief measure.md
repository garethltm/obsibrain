For a [[sample]] $s \in \ohm$ whose features are unknown, a [[belief measure]] over $\ohm$ is a function $\mu : 2^\ohm \rightarrow [0,1]$ ($2^\ohm$ because it is an option of TRUE/FALSE) such that for any $S \subseteq \ohm$, $\mu(S)$ expresses the amount of belief in the fact that $s \in S$.

Any [[belief measure]] must satisfy the follow properties:
1. [[Unit Measure]]
2. [[Additivity]]
