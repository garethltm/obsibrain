- study of the transmission, storage & retrieval of digital information
- Idea of [[Channel Capacity]]:
	- Transmission errors can be arbitrarily low as long as:
		data rate < channel capacity
- Idea of [[Entropy]]
- [[Data compression]]
- Truly random data can't be compressed
	- Ordered data can be:
		- Compression is limited by a.) [[Entropy]] (from Shannon)
			- Important for understanding everything from cell phones, to biology,
