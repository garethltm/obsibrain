- study of the transmission, storage & retrieval of digital information
	- sending & receiving messages
- Idea of [[Channel Capacity]]:
	- Encrypted message decoded into plain-text
	- [[Transmission errors]] can be arbitrarily low as long as:
		[[data rate]] < channel capacity
- Idea of [[Entropy]]
	- how difficult is is to compress information given a particular language 
		- more complex = more information needs to be decoded
- [[Data compression]]
- Truly random data can't be compressed
	- Ordered data can be:
		- Compression is limited by a.) [[Entropy]] ([[H]])
			- Important for understanding everything from cell phones, to biology, to thermodynamics, to black holes.
		- & more fundamentally by b.) Kolmogorov Complexity (K)
			- Measure of computational resources needed to specify an object, such as a piece of text
