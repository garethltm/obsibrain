- finding relevant documents in a search engine
- [[Term Frequency (tf)]]
- [[Inverse Document Frequency (idf)]]
- For query with terms t (eg: ("another","sample")) the best match document is:$$args\ max\ \Pi \tiny i\ \ \normalsize {tf(t\tiny i \normalsize,d)}\ \centerdot \ idf(t\tiny i \normalsize,D)$$
- dâˆˆD
- ${tf(t\tiny i \normalsize,d)}$ = increases
- More often, we rank the documents, rather than take the best
	- you calculate through various pages
	- highest score = most relevant
