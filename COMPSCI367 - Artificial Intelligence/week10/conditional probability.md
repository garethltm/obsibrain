$P(A\ |\ B)$ is the conditional [[probability]] that A will occur, given that B has occurred

The [[belief measure]] in hypothesis $h$ based on [[proposition]] $e$ is called the [[conditional probability]] of $h$ given $e$, written $P(h\ |\ e)$
- [[probability]] of $h$ given $e$

The [[proposition]] e represents certain given experience

The [[conditional probability]] $P(h\ |\ e)=\frac {P(h \land e)}{P(e)}$ is the [[agent]]'s [[posterior evidence (posterior)]] of $h$.
