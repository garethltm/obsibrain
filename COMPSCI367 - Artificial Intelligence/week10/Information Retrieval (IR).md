- simplest [[Shallow NLP]]

1. think of a document as an exported memory
	- useful for preserving [[knowledge]] across generations
2. just as with natural thought, [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] systems need to access memories ([[INFOSYS222 - Database Systems/Database]] in terms of [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]) relevant to a problem
	- where you use [[Knowledge Base (KB)]]/Training data to process problems

## Main Idea
- plugging in some kind of text & find documents relevant to our search string
- Idea of processing given information $\rightarrow$ new thoughts which goes back into the memory
	- fundamental operation for human beings is to recall information
