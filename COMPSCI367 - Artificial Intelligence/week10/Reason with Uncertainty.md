[[agent]]'s plans are contingent on events in the world:
- What will be the weather in Auckland tomorrow?
- Will the All Blacks win their next test match?
- Would I get head/tail if I toss a coin?

[[uncertainty]] is an important aspect of an [[agent]]'s decision making:
- [[agent]] only have [[Partially Observable]] information about the [[environment]]
- [[agent]] [[knowledge]] of the truth of a statement is uncertain
- the [[State(s)]] of the world is inherently uncertain
