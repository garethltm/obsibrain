- measure of [[uncertainty]] $\rightarrow$ amount of information provided by some data
- $p(x)$ is a [[probability]] mass function over a random variable $X$ over an alphabet (a set of discrete symbols) $X$:
$$p(x)=P(X=x),x\in X$$
>	tossing 2 dice & taking the sum(what we are interested in), we have the random variable $x = d\tiny 1\normalsize \ +\ d\tiny 2$ and
>		$p(0) = 0$,
>		$p(1) = 0$,
>		$p(2) = \frac {1}{36}$,
>		$p(3) = \frac {2}{36}, ...,p(12) = \frac {1}{36},$
>		p(13) = 0, etc.
