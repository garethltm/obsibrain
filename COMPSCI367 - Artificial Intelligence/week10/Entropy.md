- measure of [[uncertainty]] $\rightarrow$ amount of information provided by some data
- $p(x)$ is a [[probability]] mass function over a random variable $X$ over an alphabet (a set of discrete symbols) $X$:
$$p(x)=P(X=x),x\in X$$
>	tossing 2 dice & taking the sum(what we are interested in), we have the random variable x = d\tiny 1
