- the effectiveness of [[Alpha-Beta Pruning]] depends on the order in which the states are examined
	- Best case [[Time Complexity]]: 
		- $O(b^ \frac {k}{2})$
			- with [[branching factor(s)]] b
			- maximum depth k
		- Effective [[branching factor(s)]] becomes $\sqrt b$
	- Average case [[Time Complexity]]:
		- $
