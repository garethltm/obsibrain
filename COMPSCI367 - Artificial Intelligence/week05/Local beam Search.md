- adaptation of [[Iterative Best Improvement (IBI)]] by maintaining M assignments
	- where M â‰¥ 1 is a parameter
- fixed size 
	- therefore, memory s 


## Steps
1. Initialise size-M [[population]] randomly $x1,...,xM$
2. At every step, examine all [[successor(s)]] of the current [[population]] $x1,...,xM$, pick the top M [[successor(s)]] that have the lowest cost (which are going to be the next [[population]])
3. Replace $x1,...,xM$ with these M [[successor(s)]]
