- [[Search Techniques (Search Strategy) (Search Algorithm)]] inspired by [[genetics]] & [[evolution]] in biology

## Main Idea
- to apply the [[evolution]] paradigm as a [[Search Techniques (Search Strategy) (Search Algorithm)]], we need:
	1. [[candidate solution]] representation: the most common representation of a [[candidate solution]] in S is a (fixed-length) string of characters in a finite alphabet. They are also called chromosomes
	2. [[fitness]]
	3. [[crossover operation]]
