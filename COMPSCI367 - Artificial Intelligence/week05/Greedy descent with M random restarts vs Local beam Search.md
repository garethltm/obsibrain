- [[Greedy Descent]] with M random restarts: Each search process runs independently of the others
- [[Local beam Search]]: useful information is passed among the parallel search threads
	- combining the information you have

### Advantage

#### Disadvantage
- The M searches may concentrate on one search branch after a few steps
	- You basically lose diversity because it is called [[Population-based Search]] - which defeats its main purpose
