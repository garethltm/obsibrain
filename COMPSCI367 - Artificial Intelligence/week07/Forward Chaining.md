Start from [[clause(s)]] in $KB\ \cup\ Percepts$ (related to: [[Inference engines (IE)]] & generate new [[logical consequence]]
Each derivation is built on the [[clause(s)]] in $KB\ \cup\ Percepts$ or the [[clause(s)]] that have already been generated
Use a [[rule of derivation]] for inference

[[Forward Chaining]] applies [[Modus Ponens (MP)]] iteratively to the current [[Knowledge Base (KB)]] to generate a new [[clause(s)]], which are then added to [[Knowledge Base (KB)]]
