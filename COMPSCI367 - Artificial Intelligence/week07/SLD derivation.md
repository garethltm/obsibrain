- [[SLD derivation]] of a query `ask g` from $KB\ \cup\ Percepts$ is a sequence of [[Definite clause]] $\gamma0, ...,\gamma n$ :
	- The head of each $\gamma i$ is yes
	- $\gamma 0$ is $yes \leftarrow g$
	- For i >0, $\gamma i$ is obtained by [[resolution]] (at each iteration) from $\gamma i-1$ with a [[Definite clause]] in $KB\ \cup\ Percepts$: $${\frac \gamma i-1,\ a\ clause\ in\ KB\ \cup\ Percepts}{\gamma i}$$
