- [[Definite Clause Inference Engine]] need to handle queries of form `ask b` where b is an [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]]

## Implementing a definite clause inference engine
- [[Inference engines (IE)]] produces a PROOF
>Think of an inference engine as a detective. 
>
>The detective has a set of facts (the crime scene, evidence, witness statements) and a goal (to find out who committed the crime). 
>
>The detective uses logical reasoning (the inference rules) to connect the facts and reach a conclusion (the proof). 
>
>If the detective can show that the conclusion logically follows from the facts, then they have solved the case.


## Abstract Idea
- [[Proof procedure]]
- **[[Sound (Proposition)]]** 
- [[Complete (Proposition)|Complete (Proposition)]]

`S ‚ä¶ g` ([[Proof procedure]]) that are both **[[Sound (Proposition)]]** & **[[Complete (Proposition)|Complete (Proposition)]]**

1. **Forward Chaining**
    1. not very ideal/efficient
2. **SLD Resolution** (Backward chaining) - iteratively replace goals with subgoals; try to get head with an empty body
    1. potentially more efficient
