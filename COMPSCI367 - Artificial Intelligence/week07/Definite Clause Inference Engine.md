- [[Definite Clause Inference Engine]] need to handle queries of form `ask b` where b is an [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]]
	- only asking True/False of just one [[Atomic Propositions (atoms)]]

## Implementing a definite clause inference engine
- [[Inference engines (IE)]] produces a PROOF
>	#Example 
>	Think of an [[Inference engines (IE)]] as a detective. 
>	The detective has a set of facts (the crime scene, evidence, witness statements) and a [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] (to find out who committed the crime). 
>	The detective uses logical reasoning (the [[inference(s)]] rules) to connect the facts and reach a conclusion (the proof). 
>	If the detective can show that the conclusion logically follows from the facts, then they have solved the case.
