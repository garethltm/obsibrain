- [[Classical Planning]] is related to [[Goal-Based (Telelogical Agent)]]
	- what [[action(s)]] would make us closer to the [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]]

[[Planning with Uncertainty]] differs from [[Classical Planning]]:
- infinite set of [[probability]] outcomes as a search space
- [[state(s)]] changes with [[Stochastic]] elements involved
- ==non-[[Deterministic]] [[action(s)]]==
- Imperfect information
- [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] may not be achieved (up to chance). Need to [[evaluate desirability]] of outcomes

Thus the need to reason about [[uncertainty]] using tools like:
1. [[Probability Theory]]: quantifying [[uncertainty]] & calculating expectations
2. [[Bayesian Networks]]: reason about [[probability]] outcomes with imperfect information
3. [[Utility Theory]]
