- Idea of introducing a constant C 
	- $C \times \ utilities$
		- [[utility]]
- Suppose $u:\ohm \rightarrow R$ is a [[utility]] function. Then for any constant c > 0, $u': \ohm \rightarrow R$ defined by $u'(o)=cu(o)$ is also a [[utility]] function
	- preferences remain the same even when introducing a new constant
