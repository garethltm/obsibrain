- if an [[agent]] is a [[Rational Agent]], then for every [[outcome(s)]] $\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$, there is a real number 


### Consequences
- 
- cannot just sum up 2 utilities of 2 different agents
	- because if we have different [[agent]] in the system $\rightarrow$ they might have outcomes that cannot be compared because we don't know in what scale they are working
