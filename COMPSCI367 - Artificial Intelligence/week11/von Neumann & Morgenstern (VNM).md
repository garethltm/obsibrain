if an [[agent]] is a [[Rational Agent]], then for every [[outcome(s)]] $\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$, 
there is a real number u($\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$) such that:
- $\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$ > $\huge o\tiny j\normalsize$ if and only if u($\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$) > u($\huge o\tiny j\normalsize$) AND
- [[utility]] are linear with [[Probability]]

### Consequences of [[(VNM-) rational]]
finding out the most preferred [[outcome(s)]]
- although preferences may seem to be complex & multifaceted, a [[Rational Agent]]'s value for an [[outcome(s)]] can be measured by a (one-dimensional) number u($\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$) - the [[utility]] of the [[outcome(s)]] $\huge o\tiny i\normalsize$
- the [[utility]] of a [[Probability]] [[outcome(s)]] 



- cannot just sum up 2 utilities of 2 different agents
	- because if we have different [[agent]] in the system $\rightarrow$ they might have outcomes that cannot be compared because we don't know in what scale they are working
