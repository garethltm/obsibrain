- An [[agent]] together with its [[environment]]

## Representing the world
- a finite [[State Space]] → in regards to the series of [[action(s)]] performed to achieve the [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]]
- [[fully observable]] → no need to worry about uncertainty
- [[deterministic]] action → knowing the before & after [[state(s)]] that the [[action(s)]] is performed

>>**basically its saying that everything is in a controlled environment**
