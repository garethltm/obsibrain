- An [[agent]] together with its [[environment]]

## Representing the world
- a finite [[State Space]] ([[finite]]) → in regards to the series of actions performed to achieve the goal state
- fully observable → no need to worry about uncertainty
- deterministic action → knowing the before & after states that the action is performed

**basically its saying that everything is in a controlled environment**
