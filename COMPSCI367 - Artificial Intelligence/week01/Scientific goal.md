to understand the principles that make intelligent behaviour possible in natural or artificial systems:
- analyse natural and artificial agents
- formulate and test hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent [[Agent]]
- design, build and experiment with computational systems that perform [[Tasks]] that require intelligence
