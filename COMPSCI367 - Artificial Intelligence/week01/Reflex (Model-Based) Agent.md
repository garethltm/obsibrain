- Also known as Model-Based [[Agent]]
- most effective way to handle [[Partially Observable]] is for the [[Agent]] to keep track of the part of the [[world]] it can't see
- [[Agent]] should maintain some sort of internal [[State]]
- Knowledge about "how the [[World]] works" - is called the model of the world

	- Searching several moves ahead
	- Complex [[Tasks]] requiring many individual steps
	- Logical reasoning to achieve goals
