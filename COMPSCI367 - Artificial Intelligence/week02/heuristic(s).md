- a [[solution(s)]] to relaxed problems, where some of the [[constraint(s)]] of the original problem have been removed
- Heuristics are “rules of thumb”
- Heuristics are criteria, methods or principles for decing which among several alternative courses of action promises to be the most effective in order to achieve some goal
- Can make use of heuristics in deciding which is the most “promising” path to take during search
- In search, heuristic should be an underestimate of actual cost to get from current node to any goal - an admissible heuristic
- Denoted h(n); h(n) = 0 when ever n is a goal node

## Main idea
- in an ideal scenario where there are no limitation, what is the best possible [[solution(s)]]

### Summary
- [[Admissible heuristic]]
- Comparing [[heuristic(s)]]
> Good [[heuristic(s)]] can help [[A-Star Search]] algorithm to find the [[solution(s)]] faster
