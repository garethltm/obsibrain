- a [[solution(s)]] to relaxed problems, where some of the [[constraint(s)]] of the original problem have been removed

## Main idea
- in an ideal scenario where there are no limitation, what is the best possible [[solution(s)]]

### Summary
- [[Admissible heuristic]]
- Comparing [[heuristic(s)]]
> Good [[heuristic(s)]] can help [[A-Star Search]] algorithm to find the [[solution(s)]] faster
