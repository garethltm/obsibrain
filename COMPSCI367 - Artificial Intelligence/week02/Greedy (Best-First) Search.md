## Main Idea
- select the [[path(s)]] whose end is closest to a [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] according to the [[heuristic(s)]] function
- selects the next node for expansion using the [[heuristic(s)]] function for its evaluation function, ie. `f(n) = h(n)`
    - `h(n)=0` â†’ n is a [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]]
    > Example: greedy search **minimises the estimated cost to the [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]]**; it expands whichever node n is estimated to be closest to the [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]]
- It treats the [[frontier]] as a [[priority queue]] ordered by h

## Properties
- [[Complete]] 
	- generally no! can get stuck in loops
    > Example: but complete in finite space with repeated-state checking
- [[Time Complexity]]
	- O($b^m$), where m is the maximum depth in search space
- Space: O($b^m$) (retains all nodes in memory)
    
- Optimal: No!
