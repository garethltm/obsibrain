- combination of both [[Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) (Lowest-Cost-First Search)]] & [[Greedy (Best-First) Search]]

**[[Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) (Lowest-Cost-First Search)]]** 
- orders by **path cost** or backward cost: **g(n)**
**[[Greedy (Best-First) Search]]** 
- orders by **goal proximity** or forward cost: **h(n)**
ASearch orders by the sum: f(n) = g(n)* + **h(n)**
