can only distinguish between [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] from non-goal states
- [[Uninformed Search]] algorithms - algorithms that are given **no information** about the problem other than its definition
    - some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, but none of them can do it efficiently
## Summary
- problem formulation usually requires abstracting away real-world details to define a [[State Space]] that can be feasibly be explored
- variety of [[Uninformed Search]] strategies
- [[Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)]] uses only linear [[Space Complexity]] and not much more [[Time Complexity]] than other [[Uninformed Search]] algorithms
# Types of Uninformed Search
- [[Breadth-First Search (BFS)]]
- [[Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) (Lowest-Cost-First Search)]]
- [[Depth-First Search (DFS)]]
- [[Depth-Limited Search (DLS)]]
- [[Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)]]
- [[Bidirectional Search]]

> Potential Exam Format:
> We have very limited [[Space Complexity]] but we have a lot of [[Time Complexity]], we have a problem with a lot of [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] states in it 
>
