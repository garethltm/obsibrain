can only distinguish between [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] from non-goal states
# Types of Uninformed Search
- [[Breadth-First Search (BFS)]]
- [[Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) (Lowest-Cost-First Search)]]
- [[Depth-First Search (DFS)]]
- [[Depth-Limited Search (DLS)]]
- [[Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)]]
- [[Bidirectional Search]]

## Complexity Results for Uninformed Search

![[Pasted image 20231022020302.png]]

> Potential Exam Format:
> We have very limited [[Space Complexity]] but we have a lot of [[Time Complexity]], we have a problem with a lot of [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] states in it 
> 
> What algorithm would you use?
## Summary
- problem formulation usually requires abstracting away real-world details to define a [[State Space]] that can be feasibly be explored
- variety of [[Uninformed Search]] strategies
- [[Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)]] uses only linear [[Space Complexity]] and not much more [[Time Complexity]] than other [[Uninformed Search]] algorithms
