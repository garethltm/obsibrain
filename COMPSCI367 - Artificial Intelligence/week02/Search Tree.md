- super imposed over the [[state space]]
- Root: search node corresponding to the [[Initial State (Start State)]]
- Leaf nodes: correspond to states that have no successors in the tree because they were not expanded or generated no new nodes
Every time we perform a search, we actually have to create a [[search tree]] which records all our transitions around that graph

## Extra Work
- Failure to detect repeated states can cause exponentially more work![[Pasted image 20231023153758.png]]
- LEFT: [[Search Tree]] generated by exploring the search tree on the RIGHT 
- RIGHT: Different nodes, you can reach those nodes by travelling a different [[path(s)]]

- 
If you apply [[Search Techniques (Search Strategy) (Search Algorithm)]], you might get repeated states; It will then grow **EXPONENTIALLY**
- If we apply [[Breadth-First Search (BFS)]], we shouldnâ€™t bother expanding the circled node
