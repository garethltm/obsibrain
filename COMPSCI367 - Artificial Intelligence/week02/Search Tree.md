- super imposed over the [[state space]]
- Root: search node corresponding to the [[initial state (start state)]]
- Leaf nodes: correspond to [[state(s)]] that have no [[successor(s)]] in the tree because they were not expanded or generated no new nodes
Every time we perform a search, we actually have to create a [[search tree]] which records all our transitions around that graph
