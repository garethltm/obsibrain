### Types of Constraints
- Hard Constraints (strictly needs to be TRUE inorder to find a [[solution(s)]])
	- Unary constraints involve a single variable
		M ≠ 0​
	- Binary constraints involve pairs of variables
		SA ≠ WA​
	- Higher-order constraints involve 3 or more variables (might also involve hidden variables)
		Y = D + E​ OR Y = D + E - 10​
	- Inequality constraints on continuous variables
