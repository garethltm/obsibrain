- [[Uninformed Search]] algorithms - algorithms that are given **no information** about the problem other than its definition
    - some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, but none of them can do it efficiently
- Informed search strategy
    - one that uses problem-specific knowledge beyond the definition of the problem itself
    - can find solutions more efficiently than uninformed strategy
- Informed search algorithms, can do quite well given some guidance on where to look for solutions
- All implemented using a priority queue to store frontier nodes
