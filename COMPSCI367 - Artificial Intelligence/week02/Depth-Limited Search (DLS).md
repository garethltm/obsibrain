- solves the infinite loop **problem**

## Properties
- [[COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week02/Complete]]
    - Yes - no infinite loops anymore
	- Even if there is loops in the graph, it canâ€™t go infinitely as it would cycle within the limit of the maximum number of steps but will still need to go back and traverse to other parts of the graph
- [[Time Complexity]]
    - $O(b^k)$ 
	    - where k is the depth limit
- [[Space Complexity]]
    - $O(bk)$ 
	    - linear space similar to [[Depth-First Search (DFS)]]
- [[Optimal]]
    - No, can find [[suboptimal]] [[solution(s)]] first
	1. If u set the limit at the level of the [[solution(s)]] 
		- it is supposed to find it at the shallowest level. 
	2. If your depth limit is higher than the depth of the [[solution(s)]]
		- it might take extra steps to arrive to the [[solution(s)]]

>Expands nodes like [[Depth-First Search (DFS)]] but imposes a cutoff on the maximum depth of [[path(s)]]
