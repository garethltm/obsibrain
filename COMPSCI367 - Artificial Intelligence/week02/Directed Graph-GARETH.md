- Consists of 
	- a set of N of nodes
	- a set of A of [[arc]] where an [[arc]] is an ordered pair of nodes
		- The [[arc]] $<n1, n2>$ is an outgoing [[arc]] from $n1$ & an incoming [[arc]] to $n2$
	- a [[path(s)]]
	- a [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] is a boolean function on nodes. If `goal(n)` is true, then we can conclude that node n satisfies the [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] & n is a [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]] node

To encode problems as graphs:
1. One node is identified as [[initial state (start state)]]
2. A [[solution(s)]] is a [[path(s)]] from [[initial state (start state)]] to a node that satisfies that [[goal(s) - goal state(s)]]
