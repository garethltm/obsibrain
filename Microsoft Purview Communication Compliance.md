is an insider risk solution that helps you detect, capture, and act on inappropriate messages that can lead to potential data security or compliance incidents within your organization. Communication compliance evaluates text and image-based messages in Microsoft and third-party apps (Teams, Viva Engage, Outlook, WhatsApp, etc.) for potential business policy violations. Including inappropriate sharing of sensitive information, threatening or harassing language and potential regulatory violations.

Communication Compliance has predefined and custom policies that allow you to check internal and external communications for policy matches so that designated reviewers can examine them. Reviewers can investigate email, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, Viva Engage, or third-party communications in your organization and take appropriate actions to make sure they're compliant with your organization's message standards.

With role-based access controls, Communication compliance supports the separation of duties between your IT admins and your compliance management team. For example, the IT group for your organization might be responsible for setting up communication compliance role permissions, groups, and policies. While investigators and reviewers might be responsible for message triage, review, and mitigation actions.
