- combines waterfall ([[Linear Approach]]) applied in an iterative fashion
- each linear sequence produces deliverable "increments" of the [[software]]
- No (visible) loops here
	- no visible feedback because it follows the waterfall approach
- Increments range from a ==core product== (initial increment) to a more ==advanced product== (subsequent increments)
- Useful:
	- when there is dearth (lack) of resources early on in the [[process]]
