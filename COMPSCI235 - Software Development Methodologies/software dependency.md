A [[software dependency]] is a relationship between software components where one component relies on the other to work properly.

Suppose the library is unavailable or not working correctly. In that case, the application cannot make queries to the [[COMPSCI235 - Software Development Methodologies/database|database]] and will not function as intended.

A [[software dependency]] can be external or internal ([[COMPSCI235 - Software Development Methodologies/Dependency|Dependency]]). 
- External dependencies are from a third party, while internal dependencies exist within the software.

Managing these is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the software can be built, deployed, and maintained predictably and reliably.
