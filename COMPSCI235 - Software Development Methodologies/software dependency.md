A software dependency is a relationship between software components where one component relies on the other to work properly. For example, if a software application uses a library to query a database, the application depends on that library.

Suppose the library is unavailable or not working correctly. In that case, the application cannot make queries to the database and will not function as intended.

A software dependency can be external or internal. External dependencies are from a third party, while internal dependencies exist within the software. Managing these is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the software can be built, deployed, and maintained predictably and reliably.
