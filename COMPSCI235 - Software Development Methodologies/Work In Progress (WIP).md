## [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits
### Initializing
- [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits are set by the team
- [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits should not promote having team members working multiple tasks at the same time
- **Setting [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits lower than the number of team members allows for room for [[AGILE]] practices**
>	#Example 
>	extra time for [[code review]], [[pair programming]]
- One suggestion is to measure the average number of items over multiple [[SPRINT (iteration)]] & use this as information to initialize [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits.
	- velocity $\rightarrow$ to determine how capable a team performance is

### Optimizing
***The main aim of [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits is to optimize the flow of work***

An inability to stay within [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits can mean:
1. The [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] is too low which leads to overflowing
2. The [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limit is highlighting inefficiencies that can provide possible room for improvement
