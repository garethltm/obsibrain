- The Session object is the public interface for the [[Object Relation Mapping (ORM)]]
- Establishes all [[COMPSCI235 - Software Development Methodologies/database|database]] conversations through internal explicit [[transaction(s)]]
	- what a Session does
- "Holding zone" for objects during the Session's lifespan
	- maintains an active reference to the set of all mapped entities which are present in memory
		- why it is done
- The session objects are proxies for table rows
	- holding zones are placeholders where the [[Object Relation Mapping (ORM)]] fetches table rows & places them into [[SQLAlchemy Session]] object
- Unit of Work:
	- lazily flushes (when you commit an optimisation feature) only those rows/columns that have changed, ordering them to maintain consistency
