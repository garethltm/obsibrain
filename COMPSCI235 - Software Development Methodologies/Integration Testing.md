- Individual units are combined & tested to verify if they are working as they intend to when integrated
- testing 2 or more [[INFOSYS222 - Database Systems/Dependency|Dependency]] [[software]] components as a group
- a [[software]] application can be tested by similarly running it, inputting values & seeing if it behaves as expected
- [[Integration Testing]] is useful but it is only complimentary to [[Unit Testing]] - where [[Unit Testing]] tests individual components in isolation
	- we should do [[Unit Testing]] first
