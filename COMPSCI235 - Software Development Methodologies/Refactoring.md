an iterative refinement of the internal program design

***"A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand & cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior"***

- remove duplication or needless complexity
- enhance [[software]] quality
- make the code flexible, simpler, changeable & understandable
