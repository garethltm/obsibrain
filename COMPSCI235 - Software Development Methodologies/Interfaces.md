[[Interfaces]] specify behaviour (a public contract)
- without data or implementation

[[Interfaces]] are drawn like [[Classes]], but without attributes
- And with the keyword $<<Interface>>$

A dotted open-triangle arrow
- From a class to an interface, means that
	- the [[Classes]] implements this [[Interfaces]], or we can say that:
		- the class fulfills the contract specified by this [[Interfaces]] or it realises the [[Interfaces]]
