- Commit
    - Recording changes to your **.git repository**
- Branch
    - Chronological chain of commits
    - **Main**: the main/default branch used to refer to the final version (previously called Master)
    - When one wants to add a new feature or fix a bug, one **creates a new branch**, dedicated to these changes
    - This helps to **avoid merging any unstable changes into the main code base** & gives the opportunity to clean up changes before merging them to the main or parent branch
