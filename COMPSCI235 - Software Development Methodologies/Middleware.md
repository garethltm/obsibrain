- As an app developer, we want to only focus on the logic rather than getting stuck with hardware/low level details
	- we'd like some help in the way of abstractions for [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]], network programming & multithreading

	>	#Example 
	>	remote method invocation, web frameworks, etc.
