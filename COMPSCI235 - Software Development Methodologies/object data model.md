The [[object data model]] is the basis of [[Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS)]]![[Pasted image 20231102155316.png]]![[Pasted image 20231102155334.png]]

- ##### Object Identity
	- Identity determines how entities are distinguished from one another
		- similar to Primary Key![[Pasted image 20231102155442.png]]
- Relationships?
	- In an [[Relational DBMS (RDBMS)]] relationships are established through matching primary key & foreign key
- Unlike relational model, in [[object data model]] multi-valued [[Attribute(s)]] are allowed (sets)
- Class at "one" end of the [[Relationship(s)]] must hold a set of related [[Object ID (OID)]]s
- Class at "many" end of the [[Relationship(s)]] must hold [[Object ID (OID)]] of parent
- Direct extension to "many-to-many"
