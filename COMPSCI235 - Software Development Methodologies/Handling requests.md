[[Flask]] provides a request object that represents the incoming [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] request

The object can be accessed in a view method (or test method) to extract request properties

`test_request_context()` causes [[Flask]] to behave as if it's handling a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] request
