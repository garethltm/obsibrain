#### Common development problem in practice:
- a build "breaks/fails"
	- success in development stage $\rightarrow$ failure in production
- a broken build is anything that prevents a build from reporting success
	- compilation error
	- failed test/inspection
	- problem with the [[COMPSCI235 - Software Development Methodologies/database|database]]
	- Deployment problem (missing dependency)

**Should be fixed immediately**
