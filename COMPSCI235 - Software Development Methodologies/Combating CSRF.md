A new [[Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] token is generated by the Web server every time a page containing a form is requested (by a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] `GET`)

When the form is submitted (via a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] `POST`), the Web server validates the [[Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] token (similarly to [[Session cookie]] validation)
- if the [[Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] is validated, & the `GET`/`POST` request pair for the form was made by the same user, the `POST` is considered to be genuine
