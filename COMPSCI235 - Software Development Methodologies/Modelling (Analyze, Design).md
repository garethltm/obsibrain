contains Blueprint

- encompasses the ==creation of models== (Domain Modelling) to better understand the requirements & the [[design(s)]]
	- converting conceptual to components
- this results in an [[analysis]]/[[design(s)]] model that developers can unambiguously interpret. [[Specification]] gets structured & formalized (uses UML)
- used to translate the requirements of a project into software components of a solution
- not only useful for [[analysis]] but is often a good conceptual model for system [[design(s)]]

>	#Example
