#### Focus on getting to DONE state

During development, it is easy to think:
	***"Oh, I'll just pause on this one while I begin on working on something else"***

Having 2 issues open means context switching between 2 different things or transferring work between teammates. 
- Ramping down on one issue & up another isn't "free"
	- it takes time & degrades focus

It is almost always better to work through the original issue rather than starting new work & not completing prior work.

In summary, [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits discourage us from impeding out own flow
