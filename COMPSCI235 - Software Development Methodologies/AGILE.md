- effective (rapid & adaptive) response to change
- effective communication among all [[stakeholders]]
- drawing customer onto the team
	- continuous feedback
- deliver multiple [[software]] increments, in an iterative fashion

- [[AGILE]] is basically both [[Evolutionary (Iterative) Approach]] & [[Incremental Approach]]
	- [[Incremental Approach]] - breaks up a project into specific areas of functionality (modules) & attempts to completely develop & test that module
	- [[Evolutionary (Iterative) Approach]] - progressively refines the functionality or capability based on user feedback & inputs
	- which all leads to the speedy development of [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]]

## Manifesto for [[AGILE]] [[software development]]
*"We are uncovering better ways of developing [[software]] by doing it & helping others to do it"*

Valuing the items on the LEFT more than the RIGHT
which are:
- Individuals & Interactions
- Working Software
- Customer Collaboration
- Responding to Change

## 12 principles of [[AGILE]] [[software]]
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy customer through **early & continuous delivery** of valuable [[software]]
2. Welcoming **changing requirements**, even late in development. [[AGILE]] processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
3. Deliver **working [[software]] frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of month - with a preference to the shorter timescale
