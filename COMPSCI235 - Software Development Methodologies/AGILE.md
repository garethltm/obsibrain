- effective (rapid & adaptive) response to change
- effective communication among all [[stakeholders]]
- drawing customer onto the team
	- continuous feedback
- deliver multiple [[software]] increments, in an iterative fashion

- [[AGILE]] is basically both [[Evolutionary (Iterative) Approach]] & [[Incremental Approach]]
	- [[Incremental Approach]] - breaks up a project into specific areas of functionality (modules) & attempts to completely develop & test that module
	- [[Evolutionary (Iterative) Approach]] - progressively refines the functionality or capability based on user feedback & inputs
	- which all leads to the speedy development of [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]]

## Manifesto for [[AGILE]] [[software development]]
*"We are uncovering better ways of developing [[software]] by doing it & helping others to do it"*

Valuing the items on the LEFT more than the RIGHT
which are:
- Individuals & Interactions
- Working Software
- Customer Collaboration
- Responding to Change

## 12 principles of [[AGILE]] [[software]]
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy customer through **early & continuous delivery** of valuable [[software]]
2. Welcoming **changing requirements**, even late in development. [[AGILE]] processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
3. Deliver **working [[software]] frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of month - with a preference to the shorter timescale
4. Business people & developers must **work together daily** throughout the project
5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment & support they need, & trust them to get the job done
6. The most efficient & effective method of conveying information to & within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. [[AGILE]] processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers & users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence & good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential
11. The best architectures, requirements & designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes & adjusts its behaviour accordingly
