[[eXtreme Programming (XP)]] is one of several popular [[AGILE]] development processes.

"XP is a lightweight methology for small to medium sized teams developing [[software]] in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements"

## 5 Core Values

3. Feedback
	- Customer Onsite
4. Courage
	- to adapt to change

#### Main focus

1. Testing (Test are written prior to code)
	- the developers continually write [[Unit Testing]] code, which need to pass for the development to continue
	- the customers write tests to verify that the features are implemented
	- tests are automated ([[Automated Testing]]) so that they become part of the system can be continuously run to ensure the working of the system
2. Pair programming (Driver & Passenger roles)
	- all production [[software]] is built by 2 programmers, sitting side by side & performing [[code quality]] checks, at the same machine
3. [[Continuous Integration (CI)]] (committing to the main line)
	- keep system fully integrated at all times by committing multiple builds each day
		- not deviating from the main line
4. [[Refactoring]] (Code is continuously refactored)
	- iterative refinement of the internal program design
5. Short Releases (Release new versions in short cycles)
	- put a simple system into production quickly & then release new versions in very short cycles
6. Coding Standards (Code is consistent)
	- follow a common coding standard, so that all the code in the system looks as if it was written by a single (competent) individual

1. Planning
	- Begins with the creation of a set of stories ([[user story]])
	- each story is written by the customer & is placed on an index card
	- the customer assigns a value
