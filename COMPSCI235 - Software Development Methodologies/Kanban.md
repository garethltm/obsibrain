is an [[AGILE]] process model that is used to optimize the flow of work in a team

think of a factory thing where there is continuous movement in a production of a car or something

***Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress & maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project (or user story) from start to finish.***

- A [[Kanban]] approach DROPS time-boxed iterations ([[SPRINT (iteration)]]). Instead, it focuses on continuous flow

### Characteristics
1. [[Kanban]] facilitates a "[[lean pull system]]" & not a "wasteful push system"
	- no delegation of tasks
2. [[Kanban]] uses visual cues
	- like a signboard kinda thing literally translates to signboard
3. To increase efficiency, limit [[Work In Progress (WIP)]]
