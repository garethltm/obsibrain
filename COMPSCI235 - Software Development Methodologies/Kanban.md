is an [[AGILE]] process model that is used to optimize the flow of work in a team

>	#Example 
>	think of a factory thing where there is continuous movement in a production of a car or something

***Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress & maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project (or user story) from start to finish.***

- A [[Kanban]] approach DROPS time-boxed iterations ([[SPRINT (iteration)]]). Instead, it focuses on continuous flow
### [[Scrum]] vs [[Kanban]]
![[Pasted image 20231103234722.png]]

### Characteristics
1. [[Kanban]] facilitates a "[[lean pull system]]" & not a "wasteful push system"
	- no delegation of tasks
2. [[Kanban]] uses visual cues
	- like a signboard kinda thing literally translates to signboard
3. To increase efficiency, limit [[Work In Progress (WIP)]]

>	- At Testing, when developer1 is done with `ongoing` TGB it then moves to the `done`

>	- At Selected, developer1 then grabs a new story to work on which moves to Development `ongoing`

## Benefits of [[Kanban]] boards
1. [[Kanban]] boards are information hubs
2. Reduce the need for status meetings
3. Simple to maintain & low overhead
4. Improve transparency of the work process
	- basically everyone can see what you are doing

## Benefits of [[Kanban]]
1. The amount of work that is "nearly done" is constrained $\rightarrow$ This minimizes potential waste. ([[Waste elimination - Task Switching]])
	- basically making sure that a "nearly done" doesn't clog up space
2. The development team focus on getting work to a "done" state $\rightarrow$ This generates greater customer value
	- complete tasks fully
3. Bottlenecks are more easily identified. $\rightarrow$ This encourages the team to work to progress these items (swarming) & to improve engineering process, which leads to benefit (1) & (2)

## Best practices for [[Kanban]] teams
1. Size work items in small, consistent sizes
	- [[INVEST]] acronym
2. Set the [[Work In Progress (WIP)]] limits in a way that is proportional to the team member's skill sets
3. Team members should always have something to work on
4. The goal should be sustainable [[software]] engineering culture that delivers value to the customer (should also **respect** developers, )
