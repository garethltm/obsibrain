Systems that user more than one kind of processor or cores for diverse computational tasks
- Heterogeneity means difference
- Systems differ in many ways, including:
	- Data representation
	- Data typing system used in programming languages
	- Operating system interfaces
		- Hardware differences
	- Network protocols
- Despite these differences, there is a need for systems to interoperate

- if they send those information to each other - they need to translate before sending

Network protocols that are [[open protocol]] & [[standard protocol]] help to achieve interoperability
- [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] is an [[open protocol]] & [[standard protocol]]![[Pasted image 20231101182430.png]]
