- Also known as source code management systems or revision control systems
- A system that records changes to a data file or set of data files over time so that one can recall and compare specific versions later
>	#Example 
>	**Git**, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, etc.

- Data can be:
    - text
    - webpage content
    - code (python, java, etc.)
    - etc.

- Software developers control and maintain not just source code but an **entire code base**

- Includes:
    - Source code
    - Documentation
    - Build tools (Makefiles etc.)
    - Configuration files
    - Media files
    - Others (which are required for build)

- Does not include:
    - Just one certain type of file
    - Compiled files or library files, virtual environments in Python

ðŸ’¡ **.git ignore** - is how we usually ignore those types of files

ðŸ’¡ Olden days concept of local VCS: 
	the idea of having one central server and people going to commit changes to that one central system
	Disadvantage: if that server dies down, you wonâ€™t have access to your repositories
