An [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]] is a version of a product with just enough features (**focus on main key things**) to satisfy early customers & provide feedback for future product development

For production systems, infrastructure must be developed (how to set up the server - still need to retrieve/store data) & set up, but for an [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]] this activity should be deferred (things like set up web server)
- We don't want to get into the infrastructural complexity of setting a [[Database]] - we want to get feedback from client
- Early iterations should focus on the [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]]
