1.  Choose 10 times for every word in abracadabra. You can only move right or up either 5 times. (10 5) = 252
2.  we're left with 16 people, 10 spots on the second level and 6 on the first
16!/(6!(16-6)!) if you're only fussed about the level

T1: 15!/(15-5)!

T2: 12!/(12-6)!
3.  16 balls into 4 buckets
(19 3) = 969

1.  151\*150\*149\*148\*147\*146 \*6
2.
