- Learning can be defined as searching the best hypothesis for all observed data
- For [[COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]], the hypothesis space are all possible [[COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]] that can be generated for a data set (specific)
- The learner searches through the space and returns the best hypothesis, for [[COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]], the tree that potentially best predicts new data
- If the space is small enough, it is possible to test all hypotheses (then no [[Machine Learning (ML)]] needed)
	- possible to test all [[COMPSCI361 - Machine Learning/Decision Trees|Decision Trees]] that you can come up with
