Input: set of features
Output: class label

#compsci361example 
Input: a day of the week with the quantities of food
Output: whether we got sick or not

## Goal
- Use data to find a model that outputs the label based on the features
- Model predicts whether which food make you sick (even with new combination)

1. General supervised learning problem
	- take features of examples and corresponding labels as input
	- find a model that can accurately predict the labels of new examples
2. This is the most successful/widely used machine learning technique
	- #compsci361example 
	- spam filtering, optical character recognition
