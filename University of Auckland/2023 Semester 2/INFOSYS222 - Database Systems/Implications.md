- row is not unique
	- [[0NF - 'Un'normalised]] is violated

[[0NF - 'Un'normalised]] DB design with simple non-repeating [[Attribute(s)]]
	this is already [[1NF - 1st Normal Form]]

[[1NF - 1st Normal Form]] DB with simple [[Attribute(s)]] & a PK
	this is already [[2NF - 2nd Normal Form]]

[[2NF - 2nd Normal Form]] DB with no transitive [[University of Auckland/2023 Semester 2/INFOSYS222 - Database Systems/Dependency]]
	this is already [[3NF - 3rd Normal Form]]

No room for composite & derived [[Attribute(s)]]
