- can choose their [[action(s)]] based only on what their current [[Percepts]] or have perceived in the past
- most effective way to handle [[Partially Observable]] is for the [[agent(s)]] to keep track of the part of the [[world(s)]] it can't see
- [[agent(s)]] should maintain some sort of internal [[State(s)]]
- Knowledge about "how the [[world(s)]] works" - is called the model of the [[world(s)]]

## Simple Reflex Agent
- they respond directly to [[Percepts]]

## Limitations
- [[agent(s)]] with a [[World Model]] but no planning can look into the past but not the future
- Bad for:
	- Searching several moves ahead
	- Complex [[task(s)]] requiring many individual steps
	- Logical reasoning to achieve goals
