- Consists of 
	- a set of N of nodes
	- a set of A of [[Arc]] where an [[Arc]] is an ordered pair of nodes
		- The [[Arc]] $<n1, n2>$ is an outgoing [[Arc]] from $n1$ & an incoming [[Arc]] to $n2$
	- a [[path(s)]]
	- a [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] is a boolean function on nodes. If `goal(n)` is true, then we can conclude that node n satisfies the [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] & n is a [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]] node

To encode problems as graphs:
1. One node is identified as [[Initial State (Start State)]]
2. A [[solution(s)]] is a [[path(s)]] from [[Initial State (Start State)]] to a node that satisfies that [[Goal(s) - Goal State(s)]]
