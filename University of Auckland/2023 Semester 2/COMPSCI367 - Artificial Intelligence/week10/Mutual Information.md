Therefore, we can claim:
- $H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)$
	- $I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)$ $\rightarrow$ which represents the middle area
$$I(X;Y) = \displaystyle\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\ log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\ p(y)}$$

- this basically shows how informative is one variable compared to the other
- Symmetric, non-negative measure of common information in 2 variables

- 0 when the variables are independent (no overlaps)

- [[University of Auckland/2023 Semester 2/COMPSCI367 - Artificial Intelligence/week10/Mutual Information]] grows with the dependence between variables & their [[Entropy (or self-information)]]
