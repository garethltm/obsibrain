	\hat {mi}= arg\ max\ p(mi|zh)
		= arg\ max\ \frac {p(zh|mi)\ \cdot p(mi)}{\cancel{p(zh)}}\\

		\end{split}
		\end{equation}$$$arg\ max$ $\rightarrow$ find the model that is going to maximise the [[probability]] of maori given some text in mandarin
		we can just remove the $p(zh)$ line because all the denominators would have the same model which maximises the top line
		$\frac {p(zh|mi)\ \cdot p(mi)}{p(zh)}$ $\rightarrow$ [[Bayes Theorem]]
