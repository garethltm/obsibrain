[[agent(s)]]'s plans are contingent on events in the world:
- What will be the weather in Auckland tomorrow?
- Will the All Blacks win their next test match?
- Would I get head/tail if I toss a coin?

[[uncertainty]] is an important aspect of an [[agent(s)]]'s decision making:
- [[agent(s)]] only have [[Partially Observable]] information about the [[Environment]]
>	in the real world; [[knowledge]] of something is True may not be clear
- [[agent(s)]] [[knowledge]] of the truth of a statement is uncertain
- the [[State(s)]] of the world is inherently uncertain

The [[agent(s)]] [[knowledge]] can at best provide only a [[degree of belief]]
