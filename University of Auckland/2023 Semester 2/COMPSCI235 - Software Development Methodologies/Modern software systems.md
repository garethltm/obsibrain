### Distributed system
**Spreading services across different servers**
- Multiple nodes that are physically separate, communicate & coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user
- Improves resource utilization (scalability), [[fault-tolerance]] & potentially user experience (through decrease latency - could be potentially close to the user = quick computation)

### Main characteristics
1. [[Networked]] - working independently at the same time
2. [[Concurrent]] - handle multiple client requests at the same time (multithreading)
3. [[Heterogeneous]] - interoperate (using different OS, hardware & data format)
