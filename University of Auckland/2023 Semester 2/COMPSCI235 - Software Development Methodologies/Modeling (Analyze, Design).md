contains Blueprint

- encompasses the ==creation of models== ([[Domain Modeling]]) to better understand the requirements & the [[design(s)]]
	- converting conceptual to components
- this results in an [[analysis]]/[[design(s)]] [[model]] that developers can unambiguously interpret. [[specification]] gets structured & formalized (uses UML)
