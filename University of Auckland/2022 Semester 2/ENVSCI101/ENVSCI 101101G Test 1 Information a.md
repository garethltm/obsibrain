**Biodiversity can be defined for different levels of the hierarchical organization of the biosphere. In your own words and for 3 different levels: provide one specific example of biodiversity and briefly explain how it provides resilience to an ecosystem. (in approximately 150-200 words)**

Resources(or niche complementarity) which means different species use different resources or the same resources in different ways, resulting in reduced competition. This can also mean that the species aren't competing but more on complimenting.

Facilitation is where species provide resources or alter the environment, which enable other species to perform better. 1 species may be able to alter the environment to make it better for other species to perform.

Selection(sampling effect) this provides higher statistical probability that a high productivity species will be included in a large group of species compared to a smaller group. This enable more resilience as there would have more organisms in the system.
**Explain in your own words and using the idea that science is socially informed, why initial responses to Rachel Carson dismissed her concerns about how particular human activity was impacting the environment. (in approximately 150-200 words)**
**In your own words, briefly explain three types of impacts that invasive species can have on biodiversity. Provide a specific example for each impact (in approximately 150-200 words)**
**In your own words, explain the concept of ecosystem services. For 3 specific examples of ecosystem services, describe the link(s) with biodiversity (in approximately 150-200 words)**
