- we tend to see things as smooth, continuous representations rather than abrupt changes![[Pasted image 20240326235636.png]]

## More continuity examples
1. We see 2 lines crossing more readily than 4 lines meeting in the middle because of the continuity (vertically & horizontally)
2. If you did not mean to lead the user to see the left & right, or top and bottom, to have a strong relationship, then this isn't a good layout!![[Pasted image 20240326235803.png]]
