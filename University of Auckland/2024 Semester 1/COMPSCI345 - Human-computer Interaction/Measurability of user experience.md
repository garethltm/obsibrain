- a problem on the [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/COMPSCI345 - Human-computer Interaction/Empirical|Empirical]] quantitative side

Quantitative evaluation of an attribute such as [[Usability]] or [[User eXperience (UX)]] implies some kind of measurement. 

But can you measure the [[Usability]] or [[User eXperience (UX)]]? This may come as a surprise, but neither [[Usability]] nor [[User eXperience (UX)]] is directly measurable. 

In fact, most interesting phenomena, such as teaching & learning, share the same difficulty. So we resort to measuring things we can measure & use those measurements as indicators of our more abstract & less measurable notions.
- we are always approximating, feelings cannot be directly measured

#compsci345example We can understand [[Usability]] effects such as productivity or ease of use by measuring observable user performance-based indicators such as time to complete a task & counts of errors encountered by users within task performance.
