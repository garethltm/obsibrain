- The distribution of the optical weight in an interface
	- Perception that some objects appear heavier than others
	- #compsci345example larger objects, cluster of small objects, objects with strong, intense colours
- The balance in screen design is achieved by providing an equal 'weight' of screen elements, left & right, top & bottom

## 2 common systems
1. Symmetry - a mirror image
		![[Pasted image 20240327001118.png]]
	- Symmetry can occur in any orientation as long as the elements are the same on either side of the central axis
	- Also called formal balance because a form (formula) is used
2. Asymmetry - without symmetry
		![[Pasted image 20240327001323.png]]
	- Also known as informal balance
	- used to describe a kind of balance that does not rely on symmetry
	- used if 2 or more fundamentally different parts have to be balanced
	- There are no precise rules or limits with asymmetrical balance. It can be achieved by careful placement of objects & the use of other organizational devices (like figure/ground in [[Gestalt Principles of Perception]])
