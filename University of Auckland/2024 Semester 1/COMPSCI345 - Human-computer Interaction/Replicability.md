remember that your experiment should always be replicable

- Researchers often replicate previous works for various reasons:
	1. To directly compare with their own proposed system
	2. To validate work done by others 
	3. Make sure that is also not done by pure accident
- How to make it replicable?
	1. Don't miss out on any details
	2. Avoid using tools/data/systems that are only accessible by you (makes it hard to replicate)
