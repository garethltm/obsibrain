is defined to be UX evaluation with the objective to sum up/assess the success of a UX design

| Formal [[Summative UX evaluation]]                                       | Informal [[Summative UX evaluation]]                                                                                  |

| Randomly chosen subjects/participants                                    | Deliberately non-random participant selection to get most formative information                                       |
| Concerned with having large enough sample size (number of subjects)      | Deliberately uses relatively small number of participants                                                             |
| Uses rigorous & powerful statistical techniques                          | Deliberately simple, low-power statistical techniques (eg. simple mean & sometimes, standard deviation)               |
| Results can be used to make claims about "truth" in a scientific sense   | Results cannot be used to make claims, but are used to make engineering judgements                                    |
| Relatively expensive & time consuming to perform                         | Relatively inexpensive & rapid to perform                                                                             |
| Rigorous constraints on methods & procedures                             | Methods & procedures open to innovation & adaptation                                                                  |
| Tends to yield "truth" about very specific scientific questions (A vs B) | Can yield insight about broader range of questions regarding levels of UX achieved & the need for further improvement |
| Not used within a UX design process                                      | Intended to be used within a UX design process in support of formative methods                                        |
