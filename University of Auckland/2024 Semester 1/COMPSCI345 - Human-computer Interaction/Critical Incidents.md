Here is an example from one of our [[Empirical UX Evaluation Methods]] sessions for a companion website for the Ticket Kiosk. The participant was in the middle of a benchmark task that required her to order 3 tickets to a Three Tenors concert. 

As she proceeded through the task, at one point she could not locate the button to complete the transaction. When she finally scrolled down & saw the button, the button label said, "Submit". At this point, she remarked, "I am not sure if clicking on this button will let me review my order or just send it in immediately". This is an example of a [[Critical Incidents]] that needs to be divided into separate elemental notes:
1. The button is located where it is not immediately visible
2. The label is not clear enough to help the user make a confident decision
