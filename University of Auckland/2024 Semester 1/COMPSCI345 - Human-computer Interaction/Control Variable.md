We have a cause to measure an effect. However, other variables exist whether you like it or not.
- for some, we control them

Elements you need to control to ensure what is being measured is directly caused by what is being manipulated

#compsci345example 
- If we're comparing the taste of apples & oranges, we control "the ripeness of the fruit"
- Experimenting Ebay vs Trademe vs Freecycle, we control "the platform to access them"
	- we want to have the same platform being experimented

There is almost always more than 1 variable to control.

Try to identify what will have an undesirable cause on your effect, & make sure they are constant across your experimental conditions.
