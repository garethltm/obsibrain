discouraging learning a more complex model

*"[[Regularisation]] is any modification we make to learning algorithm that is intended to reduce its [[Generalization Performance]] error but not its [[training error]]"*
### Different techniques (stopping criteria):
1. [[L1 & L2 regularisation]]
2. [[Dropout]]
3. [[Early stopping]]
4. [[data augmentation]]
