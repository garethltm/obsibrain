is a type of [[Supervised Learning]] algorithm where the output is a discrete value representing one of two classes. The two classes are often represented as 0 and 1, or -1 and 1, and they typically represent outcomes such as “yes” or “no”, “true” or “false”, “success” or “failure”, and so on.

#compsci361example 
a [[binary classification]] model could be trained to predict whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0), or whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent (1) or not fraudulent (0).

The model is trained using a set of input-output pairs, also known as training examples. Each training example consists of an input vector (or features) and a desired output value (or label). The model learns a function that maps the input to the output for these training examples. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.
## Common algorithms used 
1. [[Logistic Regression]]
2. [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]
3. [[Decision Tree(s)]]
4. [[Neural Network (NN)]] 
The choice of algorithm often depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data.
