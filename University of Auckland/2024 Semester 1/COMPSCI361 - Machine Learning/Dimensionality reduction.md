## What it does
- remove certain attribute
## When to use
- [[Curse of dimensionality]]
## Strategies/Techniques
- [[Unsupervised Learning]] - [[Principal Components Analysis (PCA)]]
- [[Supervised Learning]] - [[Attribute (Feature) selection]]
	- exploiting the target class
## Why [[Dimensionality reduction]]?
- Avoid the [[Curse of dimensionality]]
- Help eliminate irrelevant/redundant features & reduce [[Noise]]
	- [[Noise]] can include things like #compsci361example the [[Machine Learning (ML)]] algorithm assuming that you need to be a male to be a doctor (by looking at specific patterns in your dataset)
- Reduce computational resources (memory & time)
	- Reduce runtime
- Allow easier visualization
	- to see & detect patterns in your dataset
