- is a [[path of execution]] within a [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]]
	- *NOTE*: a [[thread(s)|thread(s)]] is not necessarily a [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]]
- also known as a lightweight [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]]. The concept of [[parallelism]] is to divide a [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]] into multiple [[thread(s)]]
#infosys303example having multiple tabs open in a browser represents different [[thread(s)]]
## What's the difference between a [[thread(s)]] & a process?
- Primary difference:
	- [[thread(s)]] run within the same [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]] $\rightarrow$ run in shared [[Memory]] space
	- [[University of Auckland/2024 Semester 1/INFOSYS303 - Solutions Architecture/process|process]] $\rightarrow$ separate [[Memory]] space
