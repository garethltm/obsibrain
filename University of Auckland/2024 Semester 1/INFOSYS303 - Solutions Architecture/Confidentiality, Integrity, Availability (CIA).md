### Three pillars of security: the [[Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)]] Triad
- Confidentiality: information & functions can be accessed only by properly authorized parties
- Integrity: information & functions can be added, altered or removed only by authorized persons & means
- Availability: systems, functions & data must be available on-demand according to any agreed-upon parameters regarding levels of service
Security in IT essentially the protection of information, where information is represented in data
- information $\ne$ data
	- information, meaning of that data
	- data is what we manipulate
## [[Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)]]
The NIST standard FIPS 199 characterizes [[Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)]] in terms of requirements & the definition of a loss of security in each category as:
1. [[Confidentiality]]
	- A loss of [[Confidentiality]] is the unauthorized disclosure of information
2. [[Integrity]] $\rightarrow$ 
	- A loss of [[Integrity]] is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information
3. [[Availability]]
	- A loss of [[Availability]] is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system
