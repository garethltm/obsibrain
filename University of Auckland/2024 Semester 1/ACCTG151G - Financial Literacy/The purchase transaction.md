- Comparison shop
- Discuss price first, not financing or trade-in
- Don't pay the advertised price (don't always expect a discount though, scarcity can result in premium pricing)
- Check for special buyer's incentives
- Negotiate for the best deal
- Be prepared to walk away (this is hard if you've "fallen in love" with a particular product)
